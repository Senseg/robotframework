Introduction
============

TODO: Janne

Robot Framework overview
------------------------

Robot Framework is a keyword-based test automation tool.  Tests live
in html test files and make use of keywords written in libraries to
drive the software under test.

[TODO: create picture]

Because Robot Framework is flexible and extensible, it is ideally
suited to testing complex software with a variety of interfaces: GUI,
Web, command line, Web services, etc.  


Installation
------------

0. Python & Jython
1. Windows installer
2. Source distribution
3. easy_install
4. $PATH
5. pybot --version

See from Robot Framework User Guide.


Running this demo
-----------------

To run this demo, open a command shell, cd to this directory, and type
the following command at the command line:

   pybot quickstart.html

The tests in this file will execute and generate the following reports:

report.html
   the test results summary
log.html
   the test results details
output.xml
   the test results in a portable XML format for integration with other tools

Open report.html in your browser, then click on the links to explore
the results. The report.html file links to the log.html file.

Mention some command line options, pybot --help
for example

pybot --outputdir reports --log mylog.html --name  


Introducing the sample application
----------------------------------

The sample application for this paper is a variation on a classic
login example: it’s a command-line based authentication server written
in Python. At the moment, the sample application allows a user to do
two things:

   * Create an account with a password
   * Log in with a valid user name and password

Attempting to log in with a non-existent user account or with an invalid password results in the same error message:

    Access Denied

Creating a user account results in the message:

    SUCCESS

And logging in successfully results in the message:

    Logged In

So, for example, if I issue the following commands, I should get the following responses:

    > python sut/login.py login fred password
    Access Denied

    > python sut/login.py create fred password
    SUCCESS

    > python sut/login.py login fred password
    Logged In

That’s all our little sample application does just at the moment.
It’s not much.  But it’s a start.  Now we need to add some new
capabilities to it.

* Add a mention of password reqirements
* Mention the application path


Test cases
==========

TODO: Peke

The following table has two tests:

   * User Can Create An Account And Login
   * User Cannot Log In With Bad Password


.. table:: 
   :class: example

   =====================================  =================================  ==============  ==============
               Test Case                                Action                  Argument        Argument
   =====================================  =================================  ==============  ==============
   User can create an account and log in  Create Valid User                  fred            P4ssw0rd
   \                                      Attempt to Login with Credentials  fred            P4ssw0rd
   \                                      Status Should Be                   Logged In       \
   \                                      \                                  \               \
   User cannot log in with bad password   Create Valid User                  betty           P4ssw0rd
   \                                      Attempt to Login with Credentials  betty           wrong
   \                                      Status Should Be                   Access Denied   \    
   =====================================  =================================  ==============  ==============


Notice that these tests read almost like a manual test written in
English rather than like an automated test. Robot Framework uses a
keyword approach that supports writing tests that capture the essence
of the actions and expectations in natural language.


Data-Driven Test Cases
----------------------

.. table:: 
   :class: example

   ==================================  ===============================================  =============  ======================
                Test Case                                    Action                       Password     Expected error message
   ==================================  ===============================================  =============  ======================
   Too short password                  Creating user with invalid password should fail  abCD5          ${PWD_INVALID_LENGTH}
   Too long password                   Creating user with invalid password should fail  abCD567890123  ${PWD_INVALID_LENGTH}
   Password without lowercase letters  Creating user with invalid password should fail  123DEFG        ${PWD_INVALID_CONTENT}
   Password without capital letters    Creating user with invalid password should fail  abcd56789      ${PWD_INVALID_CONTENT}
   Password without numbers            Creating user with invalid password should fail  AbCdEfGh       ${PWD_INVALID_CONTENT}
   Password with special characters    Creating user with invalid password should fail  abCD56.        ${PWD_INVALID_CONTENT}
   ==================================  ===============================================  =============  ======================


Keywords
========

TODO: Peke

Built-in keywords
-----------------

The keywords included with Robot Framework,
including generally useful keywords such as "Get Time" and "Should
Be Equal".  For a complete list of the available built-in keywords
see BuiltInLibrary wikipage.


Library keywords
----------------

Keywords defined in a Robot Framework Library. (More on Libraries
later. The keyword "Create Valid User" from the previous tests is a
User Keyword.)

Robot Framework comes with a handful of libraries including an
OperatingSystem library to support common operating system functions,
and a Screenshot library for taking screenshots.  In addition, there
are other libraries distributed in separate open source projects, such
as a Selenium library for Web testing.


.. table:: 
   :class: example

   ===============  ========================
       Setting                Value
   ===============  ========================
   Library          OperatingSystem
   Library          testlibs/LoginLibrary.py
   ===============  ========================




User-defined keywords
---------------------

Keywords defined in a Keywords table either in the test file, or in
a resources file for a test suite. (More on test suites later.)
For example:

.. table:: 
   :class: example

   ===============================================  ================  =======================================  =================
         Keyword                                          Action          Argument                               Argument
   ===============================================  ================  =======================================  =================
   Clear Login Database                             Remove File       ${DATABASE_FILE}                         \
   \                                                \                 \                                        \
   Create Valid User                                [Arguments]       ${username}                              ${password}
   \                                                Create User       ${username}                              ${password}
   \                                                Status Should Be  SUCCESS                                  \
   \                                                \                 \                                        \
   Creating user with invalid password should fail  [Arguments]       ${password}                              ${expected_error}
   \                                                Create User       example                                  ${password}
   \                                                Status Should Be  Creating user failed: ${expected_error}  \
   ===============================================  ================  =======================================  =================


User-defined keywords can include actions defined by other
user-defined keywords, built-in keywords, or library keywords.  As you
can see from this example, User-defined keywords can take parameters.
They can also return values and even contain FOR loops. For now, the
important thing to know is that User-defined keywords enable test
creators to create reusable steps for common action sequences.
User-defined keywords can also help the test author keep the tests as
readable as possible.


Variables
=========

TODO: Janne

.. table:: 
   :class: example

   ======================  =============================================================================  
       Variable                        Value
   ======================  ============================================================================= 
   ${DATABASE_FILE}        ${TEMPDIR}${/}robotframework-quickstart-db.txt
   \                       \
   ${PWD_INVALID_LENGTH}   Password must be 7-12 characters long
   ${PWD_INVALID_CONTENT}  Password must be a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters and numbers 
   ======================  =============================================================================


Built-in variables, cli, variable files


Organizing test cases
=====================

TODO: Peke

Test suites
-----------

File and directory suites


Setup and teardown
------------------

If you want a set of actions to occur before and after each test
executes, use the Test Setup and Test Teardown settings in the Setting
table like so:

.. table:: 
   :class: example

   ===============  ========================
       Setting                Value
   ===============  ========================
   Test Setup       Clear Login Database
   Test Teardown    \
   ===============  ========================


Similarly you can use the Suite Setup and Suite Teardown settings to
specify actions to be executed before and after an entire test suite
executes.


Using tags
----------

.. table:: 
   :class: example

   ============  ===========  ===========
      Setting       Value        Value
   ============  ===========  ===========
   Default Tags  quickstart   example
   ============  ===========  =========== 

Also for single test case, usages: filtering, critical tests, statistics


Creating test libraries
=======================

TODO: Janne


Here is an example test library:

.. sourcecode:: python 
   
  testlibs/LoginLibrary.py
