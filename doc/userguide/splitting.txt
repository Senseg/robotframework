It is now possible to split output files during execution so that instead of one output and log file, multiple files are generated.
The splitting of output files is controlled by command line option =--splitoutput level=, where level indicates the depth in 
directory structure from which onwards output files will be split.

Example:

supposing following directory structure:
<pre>
--Tests
  |--Subdir 1
  | |--Test Case File 1
  | |--Test Case File 2 
  |--Subdir 2
    |--Test Case File 3
</pre>

Running command:
<pre>pybot --splitoutputs 1 --output myout.xml --log mylog.html Tests </pre>
will result in following output files:

| myout.xml      | Contains information of 'Tests' and links to suboutputs  |
| myout-001.xml  | Contains information of 'Subdir 1' and Test Case Files 1&2 |
| myout-002.xml  | Contains information of 'Subdir 2' and Test Case File 3 |
| mylog.html     | Is the Log file for 'Tests' and contains linsk to sub logs. |
| mylog-001.html | Is the log file for 'Subdir1' containing logs for all testcases in Test Case Files 1&2 |
| mylog-002.html | Is the log file for 'Subdir2' containing logs for all testcases in Test Case File 3 |

The benefit of this is that the sub log files mylog-001.html and mylog-002.html  will be completed
as soon as the corresponding output file is finished and that log.html will not grow overly big.
