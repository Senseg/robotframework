Creating test cases
-------------------

This section describes the overall test case syntax. Organizing test
cases into `test suites`_ using `test case files`_ and `test suite
directories`_ is discussed in the next section.

Test case syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic syntax
''''''''''''

Test cases are constructed in test case tables from the available
keywords. Keywords can be imported from `test libraries`_ or `resource
files`_, or created in the `keyword table`_ of the test case file
itself.

.. _keyword table: `user keywords`_

The first column in the test case table contains test case names. A
test case starts from the row with something in this column and
continues to the next test case name or to the end of the table. It is
an error to have something between the table headers and the first
test.

The second column normally has keyword names. An exception to this rule
is `setting variables from keyword return values`_, when the second and
possibly also the subsequent columns contain variable names and a keyword
name is located after them. In either case, columns after the keyword name
contain possible arguments to the specified keyword.

   ==================  ===========================  ==================  ===============

Settings in the Test Case table
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Test cases can also have their own settings. Setting names are always
in the second column, where keywords normally are, and their values
are in the subsequent columns. Setting names have square brackets around
them to distinguish them from keywords. The available settings are listed
below and explained later in this section.

`[Documentation]`:opt:
    Used for specifying a `test case documentation`_.

`[Tags]`:opt:
    Used for `tagging test cases`_.

`[Setup]`:opt:, `[Teardown]`:opt:
   Specify `test setup and teardown`_. Have also synonyms
   :opt:`[Precondition]` and :opt:`[Postcondition]`,
   respectively.

`[Template]`:opt:
   Specifies the `template keyword`_ to use. The test itself will contain only
   data to use as arguments to that keyword.

`[Timeout]`:opt:
   Used for setting a `test case timeout`_. Timeouts_ are discussed in
   their own section.

Test case related settings in the Setting table
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The Setting table can have the following test case related
settings. These settings are mainly default values for the
test case specific settings listed earlier.

`Force Tags`:opt:, `Default Tags`:opt:
   The forced and default values for tags_.

`Test Setup`:opt:, `Test Teardown`:opt:
   The default values for `test setup and teardown`_. Have also synonyms
   :opt:`Test Precondition` and :opt:`Test Postcondition`,
   respectively.

`Test Template`:opt:
   The default `template keyword`_ to use.

`Test Timeout`:opt:
   The default value for `test case timeout`_. Timeouts_ are discussed in
   their own section.

Using arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The earlier examples have already demonstrated keywords taking
different arguments, and this section discusses this important
functionality more thoroughly. How to actually implement `user
keywords`__ and `library keywords`__ with different arguments is
discussed in separate sections.

Keywords can accept zero or more arguments, and some arguments may
have default values. What arguments a keyword accepts depends on its
implementation, and typically the best place to search this
information is keyword's documentation. In the examples in this
section the documentation is expected to be generated using the
`libdoc`_ tool, but the same information is available on
documentation generated by generic documentation tools such as
:prog:`javadoc`.

__ `User keyword arguments`_
__ `Keyword arguments`_

Required arguments
''''''''''''''''''

Most keywords have a certain number of arguments that must always be
given.  In the keyword documentation this is denoted by specifying the
argument names separated with a comma like :code:`first, second,
third`. The argument names actually do not matter in this case, except
that they should explain what the argument does, but it is important
to have exactly the same number of arguments as specified in the
documentation. Using too few or too many arguments will result in an
error.

The test below uses keywords :name:`Create Directory` and :name:`Copy
File` from the :name:`OperatingSystem` library. Their arguments are
specified as :code:`path` and :code:`source, destination` which means
that they take one and two arguments, respectively. The last keyword,
:name:`No Operation` from :name:`BuiltIn`, takes no arguments.

.. table:: Keywords with positional arguments
   :class: example

   =============  ================  ==================  ==================
     Test Case         Action            Argument            Argument
   =============  ================  ==================  ==================
   Example        Create Directory  ${TEMPDIR}/stuff
   \              Copy File         ${CURDIR}/file.txt  ${TEMPDIR}/stuff
   \              No Operation
   =============  ================  ==================  ==================

Default values
''''''''''''''

Arguments often have default values which can either be given or
not. In the documentation the default value is typically separated
from the argument name with an equal sign like :code:`name=default
value`, but with keywords implemented using Java there may be
`multiple implementations`__ of the same keyword with different
arguments instead. It is possible that all the arguments have default
values, but there cannot be any positional arguments after arguments
with default values.

__ `Default values with Java`_

Using default values is illustrated by the example below that uses
:name:`Create File` keyword which has arguments :code:`path, content=,
encoding=UTF-8`. Trying to use it without any arguments or more than
three arguments would not work.

.. table:: Keywords with arguments having default values
   :class: example

   =============  ================  =========================  ====================  ============
     Test Case         Action               Argument                 Argument          Argument
   =============  ================  =========================  ====================  ============
   Example        Create File       ${TEMPDIR}/empty.txt
   \              Create File       ${TEMPDIR}/utf-8.txt       Hyvä esimerkki
   \              Create File       ${TEMPDIR}/iso-8859-1.txt  Hyvä esimerkki        ISO-8859-1
   =============  ================  =========================  ====================  ============

Variable number of arguments
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

It is also possible to create keywords that accept any number of
arguments. These arguments can be combined with mandatory arguments
and arguments with default values, but the so called `varargs` are
always the last ones. In the documentation they typically have an
asterisk before the argument name like :code:`*varargs` , but there
are again `differences with Java libraries`__.

__ `Variable number of arguments with Java`_

:name:`Remove Files` and :name:`Join Paths` keywords used in the
example below have arguments :code:`*paths` and :code:`base, *parts`,
respectively. The former can be used with any number of arguments, but
the latter requires at least one argument.

.. table:: Keywords with variable number of arguments
   :class: example

   =============  ================  =================  =================  =================
     Test Case         Action            Argument           Argument           Argument
   =============  ================  =================  =================  =================
   Example        Remove Files      ${TEMPDIR}/f1.txt  ${TEMPDIR}/f2.txt  ${TEMPDIR}/f3.txt
   \              @{paths} =        Join Paths         ${TEMPDIR}         f1.txt
   \              ...               f2.txt             f3.txt             f4.txt
   =============  ================  =================  =================  =================

Named arguments
'''''''''''''''

When a keyword accepts more than one argument with a default value,
overriding only the last one using positional argument is not
possible. For example, if a keyword having arguments :code:`arg1=a,
arg2=b, arg3=c` is used as in the test below, its arguments
:code:`arg1` and :code:`arg2` both get an empty string as value
instead of their default values.

.. table:: Overriding default values with positional arguments
   :class: example

   ====================  ================  ==============  ==============  ==============
         Test Case            Action          Argument        Argument        Argument
   ====================  ================  ==============  ==============  ==============
   Positional Arguments  [Documentation]   1st and 2nd     argument get    empty strings
   \                     Example Keyword                                   value
   ====================  ================  ==============  ==============  ==============

To make giving only some of the arguments that expect default values
easier, new `named arguments` syntax was added in Robot Framework
2.5. With this syntax the arguments that need to override their
default values are given immediately after the required arguments in
format :code:`argname=value`. The arguments that should use defaults
can be simply be left out. How this works in practice is illustrated
by the example test below that uses the same keyword as the above
example. In this example the arguments that are not specified will get
their default values.

.. table:: Keywords with named arguments
   :class: example

   ====================  ================  ==============  ==============  ==============
         Test Case            Action          Argument        Argument        Argument
   ====================  ================  ==============  ==============  ==============
   Named Arguments       [Documentation]   Not specified   arguments get   default values
   \                     Example Keyword   arg3=value
   \                     Example Keyword   arg2=xxx        arg3=yyy
   ====================  ================  ==============  ==============  ==============

The named argument syntax can naturally be used with arguments
accepting default values also when no arguments are left away. This
can make argument meanings more clear than when only the value is
shown. Naming the required arguments this way is not possible,
though. Additionally, it is not possible to give first named arguments
and then varargs.

The biggest limitation of the name arguments functionality is that it
currently works only with `user keywords`_ and with `library
keywords`_ implemented with Python that use either the `static library
API`_ or the `hybrid library API`_. It is possible that support for
Java libraries and for the `dynamic library API`_ is added in the
future. Until that it is possible to create user keywords that wrap
the incompatible keywords.

.. note:: When the named argument syntax is used with user keywords,
          the argument names are given without the :var:`${}`
          decoration. For example, user keyword with arguments
          :code:`${arg1}=default, ${arg2}=second` must be used like
          :code:`arg2=override`.

The named argument syntax is used only when the part of the argument
before the equal sign matches the name of an argument with a
default value. This matching is started from the end of the given
argument list and stopped when there is no match. In those rare cases
when there are accidental matches, it is possible to use :code:`\\`
to escape this syntax like :code:`nomatch\\=here`.

.. note:: The named argument syntax is both case and space
          sensitive. The former means that if you have an argument
          :code:`arg`, you must use it like :code:`arg=<value>`, and
          :code:`Arg=<value>` or :code:`ARG=<value>` do not work.  The
          latter means that spaces are not allowed before the
          :code:`=` sign, and possible spaces after it are considered
          part of the default value itself.

The following example demonstrates using named arguments in different
scenarios, including in `test library imports`__.

Arguments embedded to keyword names
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A totally different approach to specify arguments is embedding them
into keyword names. This syntax is, at least currently, only supported
by `user keywords`__.

__ `Embedding arguments into keyword name`_

Test case name and documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The test case name comes directly from the Test Case table: it is
exactly what is entered into the test case column. Test cases in one
test suite should have unique names.  Pertaining to this, you can also
use the `automatic variable`_ :var:`${TEST_NAME}` within the test
itself to refer to the test name. It is available whenever a test is
being executed, including all user keywords, as well as the test setup
and the test teardown.

The :opt:`[Documentation]` setting allows you to set a free
documentation for a test case. That text is shown in the command line
output, as well as the resulting test logs and test reports.

If the documentation is long, it can be `split into several cells`__
that are catenated together with spaces. It is possible to use simple
`HTML formatting`_ and variables_ can be used to make the
documentation dynamic. Starting from Robot Framework 2.7, if
documentation is split in multiple lines, the lines themselves are
`catenated using newlines`__. Newlines are not added if the line already ends
with a newline or it ends with an `escaping backslash`__.

It is important that test cases have clear and descriptive names, and
in that case they normally do not need any documentation. If the logic
of the test case needs documenting, it is often a sign that keywords
in the test case need better names and they are to be enhanced,
instead of adding extra documentation. Finally, metadata, such as the
environment and user information in the last example above, is often
better specified using tags_.

Tagging test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using tags in Robot Framework is a simple, yet powerful mechanism for
classifying test cases. Tags are free text and they can be used at
least for the following purposes:

- Tags are shown in test reports_, logs_ and, of course, in the test
  data, so they provide metadata to test cases.
- Statistics__ about test cases (total, passed, failed  are
  automatically collected based on tags).
- With tags, you can `include or exclude`__ test cases to be executed.
- With tags, you can specify which test cases are considered `critical`_.

__ `Configuring statistics`_
__ `By tag names`_

In this section it is only explained how to set tags for test
cases, and different ways to do it are listed below. These
approaches can naturally be used together.

`Force Tags`:opt: in the Setting table
   All test cases in a test case file with this setting always get
   specified tags. If it is used in the `test suite initialization file`,
   all test cases in sub test suites get these tags.

`Default Tags`:opt: in the Setting table
   Test cases that do not have a :opt:`[Tags]` setting of their own
   get these tags. Starting from Robot Framework version 2.5 default
   tags are no longer supported in test suite initialization files.

`[Tags]`:opt: in the Test Case table
   A test case always gets these tags. Additionally, it does not get the
   possible tags specified with :opt:`Default Tags`, so it is possible
   to override the :opt:`Default Tags` by using empty value. Starting
   from Robot Framework 2.5.6, is also possible to use value :misc:`NONE`
   to override default tags.

`--settag`:opt: command line option
   All executed test cases get tags set with this option in addition
   to tags they got elsewhere.

`Set Tags`:name: and `Remove Tags`:name: keywords
   These `BuiltIn keywords`_ can be used to modify tags during the
   test execution.

Tags are free text, but they are normalized so that they are converted
to lowercase and all spaces are removed. If a test case gets the same tag
several times, other occurrences than the first one are removed. Tags
can be created using variables, assuming that those variables exist.

Test setup and teardown
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework has similar test setup and teardown functionality as many
other test automation frameworks. In short, a test setup is something
that is executed before a test case, and a test teardown is executed
after a test case. In Robot Framework setups and teardowns are just
normal keywords with possible arguments.

Setup and teardown are always a single keyword. If they need to take care
of multiple separate tasks, it is possible to create higher-level `user
keywords`_ for that purpose. An alternative solution is executing multiple
keywords using the `BuiltIn keyword`_ :name:`Run Keywords` that was added
in Robot Framework 2.5.

The test teardown is special in two ways. First of all, it is executed also
when a test case fails, so it can be used for clean-up activities that must be
done regardless of the test case status. Starting from Robot Framework 2.5, all
the keywords in the teardown are also executed even if one of them fails. This
`continue on failure`_ functionality can be used also with normal keywords, but
inside teardowns it is on by default.

The easiest way to specify a setup or a teardown for test cases in a
test case file is using the :opt:`Test Setup` and :opt:`Test
Teardown` settings in the Setting table. Individual test cases can
also have their own setup or teardown. They are defined with the
:opt:`[Setup]` or :opt:`[Teardown]` settings in the test case
table and they override possible :opt:`Test Setup` and
:opt:`Test Teardown` settings. Having no keyword after a
:opt:`[Setup]` or :opt:`[Teardown]` setting means having no
setup or teardown. Starting from Robot Framework 2.5.6, it is also possible
to use value :misc:`NONE` to indicate that a test has no setup/teardown.

   \                   [Teardown]       ${TEARDOWN}
   ==================  ===============  ===================  ==================

Often when creating use-case-like test cases, the terms *precondition*
and *postcondition* are preferred over the terms setup and
teardown. Robot Framework supports also this terminology, so that a
precondition is a synonym to a setup and a postcondition to a
teardown.

.. table:: Setup and teardown synonyms
   :class: tabular

   =================  ===================
   Test Setup         Test Precondition
   Test Teardown      Test Postcondition
   [Setup]            [Precondition]
   [Teardown]         [Postcondition]
   =================  ===================

The name of the keyword to be executed as a setup or a teardown can be a
variable. This facilitates having different setups or teardowns in
different environments by giving the keyword name as a variable from
the command line.

.. note:: `Test suites can have a setup and teardown of their
           own`__. A suite setup is executed before any test cases or sub test
           suites in that test suite, and similarly a suite teardown is
           executed after them.

Test templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test templates convert the normal `keyword-driven`_ test cases into
`data-driven`_ tests. Whereas the body of the normal test case is constructed
from keywords and their possible arguments, test cases with template define
only the arguments for the template keyword. This is illustrated by the
following example test cases that are functionally fully identical.

.. table:: Using test template
   :class: example

   ===================  ===============  ================  ===============
        Test Case            Action          Argument         Argument
   ===================  ===============  ================  ===============
   Normal test case     Example keyword  first argument    second argument
   \
   Templated test case  [Template]       Example keyword
   \                    first argument   second argument
   ===================  ===============  ================  ===============

As the example above illustrates, it is possible to specify the
template for an individual test case using the :opt:`[Template]`
setting. An alternative approach is using the :opt:`Test Template`
setting in the Setting table, in which case the template is applied
for all test cases in that test case file. The :opt:`[Template]`
setting overrides the possible template set in the Setting table, and
an empty value for :opt:`[Template]` means that the test has no
template even when :opt:`Test Template` is used. Starting from Robot Framework
2.5.6, it is also possible to use value :misc:`NONE` to indicate that a test
has no template.

If a templated test case has multiple data rows in its body, like in
the example below, the template is applied for all the rows. This
means that the same keyword is executed multiple times, once with data
on each row. Templated tests are also special so that all the rounds
are executed even if there are failures. It is possible to use this
kind of `continue on failure`_ mode with normal tests too, but with
the templated tests the mode is on automatically.

.. table:: Using test template with multiple data rows
   :class: example

   ===================  ===============  ================  ===============
        Test Case            Action          Argument         Argument
   ===================  ===============  ================  ===============
   Templated test case  [Template]       Example keyword
   \                    first round 1    first round 2
   \                    second round 1   second round 2
   \                    third round 1    third round 2
   ===================  ===============  ================  ===============

If templates are used with `for loops`_, the template is applied for
all the steps inside the loop. The continue on failure mode is in use
also in this case, which means that all the steps are executed with
all the looped elements even if there are failures.

   \                   :FOR             ${item}          IN          @{ITEMS}
   \                                    ${item}          2nd arg
   \                   :FOR             ${index}         IN RANGE    42
   \                                    1st arg          ${index}
   ==================  ===============  ===============  ==========  ==========

The main use case for test templates is reducing duplication with
data-driven tests. Instead of repeating the same keyword with all the
tests in a file, it is possible to use it only once in the Setting
table. This usage is illustrated more thoroughly in the next section.

.. note:: Test templates is a new feature in Robot Framework 2.5.

.. note:: It is currently not possibly to specify the template keyword
   	  using variables. This limitation may be lifted in the future
   	  versions.

Different test case styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several different ways in which test cases may be written. Test
cases that describe some kind of *workflow* may be written either in
keyword-driven or behavior-driven style. Data-driven style can be used to test
the same workflow with varying input data.

Keyword-driven style
''''''''''''''''''''

Workflow tests, such as the :name:`Valid Login` test described
earlier_, are constructed from several keywords and their possible
arguments. Their normal structure is that first the system is taken
into the initial state (:name:`Open Login Page` in the :name:`Valid
Login` example), then something is done to the system (:name:`Input
Name`, :name:`Input Password`, :name:`Submit Credentials`), and
finally it is verified that the system behaved as expected
(:name:`Welcome Page Should Be Open`).

.. _earlier: example-tests_

Data-driven style
'''''''''''''''''

Another style to write test cases is the *data-driven* approach where
test cases use only one higher-level keyword, normally created as a
`user keyword`_, that hides the actual test workflow. These tests are
very useful when there is a need to test the same scenario with
different input and/or output data. It would be possible to repeat the
same keyword with every test, but the `test template`_ functionality
allows specifying the keyword to use only once.

.. table:: Data-driven testing example
   :class: example

   |                   | credentials should fail |         |         |
   +-------------------+-------------------------+---------+---------+

.. table::
   :class: example

   +-------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
   |     Test Case     | User Name | Password  |         |
   +===================+===========+===========+=========+
   | Invalid User Name | invalid   | ${VALID   |         |
   |                   |           | PASSWORD} |         |
   +-------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
   | Invalid Password  | ${VALID   | invalid   |         |
   |                   | USER}     |           |         |
   +-------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
   | Invalid User Name | invalid   | whatever  |         |
   | And Password      |           |           |         |
   +-------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
   | Empty User Name   | ${EMPTY}  | ${VALID   |         |
   |                   |           | PASSWORD} |         |
   +-------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
   | Empty Password    | ${VALID   | ${EMPTY}  |         |
   |                   | USER}     |           |         |
   +-------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+
   | Empty User Name   | ${EMPTY}  | ${EMPTY}  |         |
   | And Password      |           |           |         |
   +-------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+

The above example has six separate tests, one for each invalid
user/password combination, and the example below illustrates how to
have only one test with all the combinations. When using `test
templates`_, all the rounds in a test are executed even if there are
failures, so there is no real functional difference between these two
styles. In the above example separate combinations are named so it is
easier to see what they test, but having potentially large number of
these tests may mess-up statistics. Which style to use depends on the
context and personal preferences.

   |                   |               | credentials should|         |
   |                   |               | fail              |         |

   |                   | ${VALID USER} | invalid           |         |

   |                   | invalid       | whatever          |         |

   +-------------------+---------------+-------------------+---------+

.. tip:: In both of the above examples, column headers have been
   	 changed to match the data. This is possible because on the
   	 first row other cells except the first one `are ignored`__.

__ `Ignored data`_

Behavior-driven style
'''''''''''''''''''''

It is also possible to write test cases as requirements that also non-technical
project stakeholders must understand. These `Executable Requirements` are a
corner stone of a process commonly called `Acceptance Test Driven Development`_
(ATDD).

One way to write these requirements/tests is *Given-When-Then* style
popularized by `Behavior Driven Development`_ (BDD). When writing test cases in
this style, the initial state is usually expressed with a keyword starting with
word :name:`Given`, the actions are described with keyword starting with
:name:`When` and the expectations with a keyword starting with :name:`Then`.
Keyword starting with :name:`And` may be used if a step has more than one
action.

.. table:: Example test cases using behavior-driven style
   :class: example

   ==================  ===========================
       Test Case                  Step
   ==================  ===========================
   Valid Login         Given login page is open
   \                   When valid username and password are inserted
   \                   and credentials are submitted
   \                   Then welcome page should be open
   ==================  ===========================

Ignoring :name:`Given/When/Then/And` prefixes
`````````````````````````````````````````````

Prefixes :name:`Given`, :name:`When`, :name:`Then` and :name:`And` are dropped
when matching keywords are searched, if no match with the full name is
found. This works for both user keywords and library keywords. For example,
:name:`Given login page is open` in the above example can be implemented as
user keyword either with or without the word :name:`Given`. Ignoring prefixes
also allows using the same keyword with different prefixes. For example
:name:`Welcome page should be open` could also used as :name:`And welcome page
should be open`.

Embedding data to keywords
``````````````````````````

When writing concrete examples it is useful to be able pass actual data to
keyword implementations. User keywords support this by allowing `embedding
arguments into keyword name`_.
