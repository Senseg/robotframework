Demonstration
-------------

Robot Framework does not currently have a standalone demo, but we plan to add
one soon. However, Selenium test library has an easily executable
demonstration test suite available. It contains a simple standalone HTTP
server and an application that is used as a system under test. The actual test
case files and scripts for running the demonstration in different systems are
also provided. 

The demonstration can be downloaded from the `SeleniumLibrary page`_, where 
also the instructions for running the demonstration can be found.
