Demonstrations
--------------

Robot Framework Quick Start Guide acts also as a standalone demo. It
is part of the source distribution (under :path:`doc/quickstart/`
directory), and also available as a separate download from `project
web pages`__.

Additionally, both external SeleniumLibrary_ and SwingLibrary_ have
easily executable demos available. The former contains a simple
standalone HTTP server and an application that is used as a system
under test, and the latter has a small Swing application. The actual test
case files and scripts for running demos on different systems are also
provided.
