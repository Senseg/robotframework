An easily executable demonstration test suite for Robot Framework
using SeleniumLibrary is now available. It contains a simple
standalone HTTP server and an application that is used as a system
under test. The actual test case files and scripts for running the
demonstration in different systems are also provided. You can see a 
screenshot of Selenium working in the figures below:
