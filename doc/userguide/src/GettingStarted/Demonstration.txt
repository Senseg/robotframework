Demonstration
-------------

Robot Framework does not currently have a standalone demo, but we plan
to add one soon. However, SeleniumLibrary has an easily executable
demonstration test suite available. It contains a simple standalone
HTTP server and an application that is used as a system under
test. The actual test case files and scripts for running the
demonstration in different systems are also provided.

The demonstration, as well as instructions for running it, can be
downloaded from SeleniumLibrary project page at
http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-seleniumlibrary.
