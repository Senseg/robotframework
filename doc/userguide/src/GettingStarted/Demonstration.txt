Demonstrations
--------------

Robot Framework Quick Start Guide acts also as a standalone demo. It
is part of the source distribution (under :path:`doc/quickstart/`),
and also available as a separate download from `project web pages`__.

Additionally, external SeleniumLibrary__ has an easily executable
demonstration test suite available. It contains a simple standalone
HTTP server and an application that is used as a system under
test. The actual test case files and scripts for running the
demonstration in different systems are also provided.
