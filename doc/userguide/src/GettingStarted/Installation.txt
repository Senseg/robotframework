Installation and uninstallation
-------------------------------

These instructions cover installing Robot Framework and its preconditions on
different operating systems. Installation changed considerably in Robot
Framework 2.7. The most important changes are `listed separately`__ and `previous
User Guides`_ can be consulted for details about installing earlier versions.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip:: If you have pip_ installed, just run :cli:`pip install robotframework`.

Supported installation approaches
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework is implemented with Python_ and also runs on Jython_ (JVM) and
IronPython_ (.NET) interpreters. Before installing the framework, an obvious
precondition_ is installing the needed interpreters.

Different ways to install Robot Framework itself are listed below and explained
more thoroughly in this chapter. All installation packages are available from
http://downloads.robotframework.org.

`Installing from source`_
    You can get the source code either by downloading and extracting a source
    distribution or checking it out directly from version control system.
    After that you can install the framework by running :cli:`python setup.py install`
    command. This approach works on all operating systems and with all interpreters.

`Using Windows installer`_
    There are graphical installers for both 32 bit and 64 bit Windows systems.

`Python package managers`_
    Python package managers such as pip_ and `easy_install`_ make installation
    trivial.

`Using One Click Installer`_
    If you are using Windows XP and you do not have preconditions installed,
    `One Click Installer`_ can take care of installing everything.

`Standalone JAR distribution`_
    If running tests with Jython is enough, the easiest approach is downloading
    the standalone :prog:`robotframework-<version>.jar` that contains
    both Jython and Robot Framework.

`Manual installation`_
    If you have special needs and nothing else works, you can always do
    a custom manual installation.

Different entry points
''''''''''''''''''''''

.. _runner script:

Runner scripts
``````````````

Robot Framework has different entry points for `executing test cases`_ and for
`post-processing outputs`_ based on earlier test results. For both of
these usages there are also different runner scripts for different
interpreters:

.. table:: Different runner scripts
   :class: tabular

   =============  ==============  ================
    Interpreter   Test execution  Post-processing
   =============  ==============  ================
   Python         :prog:`pybot`   :prog:`rebot`
   Jython         :prog:`jybot`   :prog:`jyrebot`
   IronPython     :prog:`ipybot`  :prog:`ipyrebot`
   =============  ==============  ================

On UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and OSX, the runner scripts
are implemented using Python, and on Windows they are batch files. Regardless of
the operating system, using any of these scripts requires that the appropriate
interpreter is in PATH_.

.. note::  Prior to Robot Framework 2.7, the runner scripts were implemented
           as shell scripts outside Windows.

.. _entry point:
.. _direct entry points:

Running tests and post-processing output directly
`````````````````````````````````````````````````

In addition to the above runner scripts, it is possible to both
run tests and post-process outputs by executing framework's entry points
directly using a selected interpreter. It is possible to execute
them as modules using Python's :opt:`-m` option and, if you know where
the framework is installed, to run them as scripts. The entry points
are listed on the following table using Python, and examples below
illustrate using them also with other interpreters.

.. table:: Direct entry points
   :class: tabular

   ==================  ============================  ==================================
       Entry point              Run as module                   Run as script
   ==================  ============================  ==================================
   Test execution      :cli:`python -m robot.run`    :cli:`python path/robot/run.py`
   Post-processing     :cli:`python -m robot.rebot`  :cli:`python path/robot/rebot.py`
   ==================  ============================  ==================================

.. sourcecode:: bash

   # Run tests with Python by executing `robot.run` module.
   python -m robot.run

   # Run tests with Jython by running `robot/run.py` script.
   jython path/to/robot/run.py

   # Create reports/logs with IronPython by executing `robot.rebot` module.
   ipy -m robot.rebot

   # Create reports/logs with Python by running `robot/rebot.py` script.
   python path/to/robot/rebot.py

.. note::  Old :code:`robot.runner` entry point has been deprecated in
           Robot Framework 2.7 and :code:`robot.run` should be used instead.

Built-in tools
``````````````

Starting from Robot Framework 2.7, libdoc_, testdoc_, and tidy_ tools are
bundled with the core framework and have their own entry points. Also they can
be executed both as a module using the :opt:`-m` option or directly as a script.
The table below lists the entry points using Python but they can be used with
any supported interpreter.

.. table:: Entry points to built-in tools
   :class: tabular

   =================  ===============================  ======================================

   =================  ===============================  ======================================

Verifying installation
``````````````````````

After a successful installation, you should be able to execute created `runner
scripts`_ with :opt:`--version` option and get both Robot Framework and interpreter
versions as a result.

.. sourcecode:: bash

   $ pybot --version
   Robot Framework 2.7 (Python 2.6.6 on linux2)

   $ jybot --version
   Robot Framework 2.7 (Jython 2.5.2 on java1.6.0_21)

Changes compared to Robot Framework 2.6 and earlier
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

Robot Framework installation has changed quite a bit between 2.6 and
2.7 versions and the most important changes are listed below. If you need
more information about installing older versions, please consult the `previous
User Guides`_.

- Installation using pip_ is finally supported.
- Installation using IronPython_ is officially supported. As a result you get
  new :prog:`ipybot` and :prog:`ipyrebot` `runner scripts`_.
- Installation using Jython creates new :prog:`jyrebot` runner script in addition
  to :prog:`jybot`. :prog:`rebot` script is not created anymore with Jython.
- Installing from source using Python **does not** create :prog:`jybot` script
  anymore. You need to install the framework using Jython to create it.
- All `runner scripts`_ require the appropriate interpreter to be in PATH_.
- Outside Windows, `runner scripts`_ are implemented in Python.
- :prog:`robot/runner.py` `entry point`_ has been deprecated in favor of
  :prog:`robot/run.py` and also programmatic execution API has changed.
- `Source distribution`_ only contains actual source code and tools. You
  need to download, for example, User Guide and Quick Start Guide separately
  or view them online.

.. _precondition:

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework is supported on Python_, Jython_ (JVM) and IronPython_ (.NET)
and should also run on PyPy_. The interpreter you want to use should be
installed before installing the framework.

Which interpreter to use depends on the needed test libraries and test
environment in general. Some libraries use tools or modules that only work
with Python, while others may use Java_ tools that require Jython or need
`.NET`_ and thus IronPython. There are also many tools and libraries that run
fine with all interpreters.

If you you do not have special needs or just want to try out the framework,
it is recommended to use Python. It is the most mature implementation,
considerably faster than Jython or IronPython (especially start-up time is
faster) and also readily available on most UNIX-like operating systems.

Python installation
'''''''''''''''''''

On most UNIX-like systems such as Linux and OSX you have Python
installed by default. If you are on Windows or otherwise need to
install Python yourself, your best place to start is http://python.org.
There you can download a suitable installer and get more information about
the installation process and Python in general.

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5, Python 2.5 is the minimum supported
Python version. Earlier versions support also Python 2.3 and
2.4. Robot Framework is currently not compatible with Python 3.x
versions.

.. note::  Running Robot Framework on Python using :prog:`pybot` `runner script`_
           requires :prog:`python` to be executable on the command prompt.
           This means that you need to make sure it is in PATH_.

.. note::  On Windows, and especially on Windows Vista and Windows 7, it is
           recommended to install Python to all users, and to run the
           installation as an administrator.

.. note::  Environment variable :var:`PYTHONCASEOK` should be not set on Windows
           machines. Robot Framework will not work correctly with it.

Jython installation
'''''''''''''''''''

Using test libraries implemented with Java_ or using Java tools internally
requires running Robot Framework on Jython_, which in turn requires Java Runtime
Environment (JRE). Installing Jython is a fairly easy procedure, and the first
step is getting an installer from http://jython.org. The installer is an
executable JAR package, which you can run from the command line like
:cli:`java -jar jython_installer-<version>.jar`. Depending on the system
configuration, it may also be possible to just double-click the installer.

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5, the minimum supported Jython version is 2.5
which requires Java 5 (a.k.a. Java 1.5) or newer. Earlier Robot Framework
versions support also Jython 2.2.

.. note::  Running Robot Framework on Python using :prog:`jybot` `runner script`_
           requires :prog:`jython` to be executable on the command prompt.
           This means that you need to make sure it is in PATH_.

.. note::  Starting from Robot Framework 2.7, installing the framework with
           Python using `source distribution`_ does not create :prog:`jybot`
           `runner script`_ anymore. You need to install the framework using
           Jython separately.

IronPython installation
'''''''''''''''''''''''

IronPython_ allows running Robot Framework on the `.NET`_ platform.
Installation with IronPython is officially supported starting from Robot Framework
2.7. Only IronPython 2.7.x on .NET 4.0 series is officially supported and tested.

When using IronPython, an additional dependency is installing elementtree__
module 1.2.7 preview release. This is required because the :code:`elementtree`
version distributed with IronPython is broken__. You can do the installation
by downloading the source distribution, unzipping it, and running
:cli:`ipy setup.py install` on the command prompt in the created directory.

.. note::  Running Robot Framework on Python using :prog:`ipybot` `runner script`_
           requires :prog:`ipy` to be executable on the command prompt.
           This means that you need to make sure it is in PATH_.

__ http://effbot.org/downloads/#elementtree
__ http://ironpython.codeplex.com/workitem/31923

.. _PATH:

Setting :var:`PATH`
'''''''''''''''''''

The :var:`PATH` environment variable lists locations where commands
executed in a system are searched from. To make using Robot Framework
easier from the command prompt, it is recommended to add the locations
where the `runner scripts`_ are installed into :var:`PATH`. The runner
scripts themselves require the matching interpreter to be in :var:`PATH`,
so the installation location must be added there too.

When using Python on UNIX-like machines both Python itself and scripts
installed with should be automatically in :var:`PATH` and no extra actions
needed. On Windows and with other interpreters :var:`PATH` must be configured
separately.

What directories to add
```````````````````````

What directories you need to add to :var:`PATH` depends on the
interpreter and operating system. The first location is the installation
directory of the interpreter (e.g. :path:`c:\\Python27`) and the other is
the location where scripts are installed with that interpreter. Both Python
and IronPython install scripts to :path:`Scripts` directory under the
installation directory on Windows (e.g. :path:`c:\\Python27\\Scripts`)
but Jython uses :path:`bin` directory (e.g. :path:`c:\\jython2.5.2\\bin`).

.. note::  On Windows it is highly recommended to add at least Python
           installation directory into :var:`PATH` *before* installing
           Robot Framework itself.

.. note::  :path:`Scripts` and :path:`bin` directories may not be created
           as part of the interpreter installation but only later when
           Robot Framework or some other third party module is installed.

Setting :var:`PATH` on Windows
``````````````````````````````

On Windows you can configure :var:`PATH` by following the steps
below. Notice that the exact setting names may be different on
different Windows versions, but the basic approach should still be the same.

  1. Open ``Start > Settings > Control Panel > System > Advanced >
     Environment Variables``.  There are ``User variables`` and ``System
     variables``, and the difference between them is that User variables
     affect only the current users, whereas System variables affect all
     users.

  2. To edit the existing :var:`PATH`, select ``Edit`` and add
     :path:`;<InstallationDir>;<ScriptsDir>` at the end of the value
     (e.g. :path:`;c:\\Python27;C:\\Python27\\Scripts`).
     Note that the semicolons (:path:`;`) are important as they separate
     the different entries. To add a new value, select ``New`` and set both
     the name and the value, this time without the leading semicolon.

  3. Exit the dialog with ``Ok`` to save the changes.

  4. Start a new command prompt for the changes to take effect.

Setting :var:`PATH` on UNIX-like systems
````````````````````````````````````````

On UNIX-like systems you typically need to edit either some system
wide or user specific configuration file. Which file to edit and how
depends on the system, and you need to consult your operating system
documentation for more details.

Installing Robot Framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing from source
''''''''''''''''''''''

This installation method can be used on any operating system with any
of the supported interpreters. Installing *from source* can sound a
bit scary, but the procedure is actually pretty straightforward.

.. _source distribution:

Getting the source code
```````````````````````

You typically get the source by downloading a *source distribution package*
in :path:`.tar.gz` format from the `download page`_. You need to extract
the package somewhere and, as a result, you get a directory named
:path:`robotframework-<version>`. The directory contains the source code,
scripts needed for installing it, and some `supporting tools`_ under the
:path:`tools` directory.

.. note::  Starting from Robot Framework 2.7, the source distribution does not
           contain documentation or templates. They must be downloaded
           separately or viewed online.

An alternative approach for getting the source code is checking it out directly
from project's `version control system`_. By default you will get the latest
code, but you can easily switch to different released versions or other tags.

Installation
````````````

Robot Framework is installed from source using Python's standard :prog:`setup.py`
script. The script is on the directory containing the sources and you can run
it from the command line using any of the supported interpreters:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   # Installing with Python. Creates `pybot` and `rebot` scripts.
   python setup.py install

   # Installing with Jython. Creates `jybot` and `jyrebot` scripts.
   jython setup.py install

   # Installing with IronPython. Creates `ipybot` and `ipyrebot` scripts.
   ipy setup.py install

.. note::  Starting from Robot Framework 2.7, installation using Python *does
           not* create :prog:`jybot` `runner script`_ anymore. To create it,
           you need to install the framework separately using Jython.

Different installation scripts
``````````````````````````````

The standard :prog:`setup.py` script accepts several arguments allowing,
for example, installation into non-default locations that do not require
administrative rights. It is also used for creating different distribution
packages. Run :cli:`python setup.py --help` for more details.

Robot Framework has also a custom :prog:`install.py` script that supports both
installation and uninstallation_. Run it without arguments for more details.

.. _Windows installer:

Using Windows installer
'''''''''''''''''''''''

There are separate graphical installers for 32 bit and 64 bit Windows
systems. The former installer has name in format
:prog:`robotframework-<version>.win32.exe` and the latter
:prog:`robotframework-<version>.win-amd64.exe`, and both are available on the
`download page`_. Running the installer requires double-clicking it and
following the simple instructions.

Windows installers always run on Python and create the standard :prog:`pybot`
and :prog:`rebot` `runner scripts`_. Unlike the other provided installers,
these installers also automatically create :prog:`jybot` and :prog:`ipybot`
scripts. To be able to use the created runner scripts, both the
:path:`Scripts` directory containing them and the appropriate interpreters
need to be in PATH_.

.. note::  It is highly recommended to set Python installation directory into
           :var:`PATH` *before* running Robot Framework installer.

.. note::  If you have multiple versions of Python or other interpreters
           installed, the executed runner scripts will always use the one
           that is *first* in :var:`PATH` regardless under what Python version
           that script is installed. To avoid that, you can always use
           the `direct entry points`_ with the interpreter of choice like
           :cli:`c:\\Python25\\python.exe -m robot.run`.

.. note::  On Windows Vista and Windows 7 installing Robot Framework typically
           requires administrator privileges. Select ``Run as administrator``
           from the context menu when starting the installer.

Python package managers
'''''''''''''''''''''''

Python nowadays has various good package managers available for
installing and otherwise managing Python packages. The most well known ones are
`easy_install`_ and its successor `pip`_. We highly recommend
:prog:`pip` as it is more actively developed and has nice features such as
uninstallation_ support.

Different package managers have different usage, but with :prog:`pip`
and :prog:`easy_install` the basic usage is similar:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    # Install the latest version
    pip install robotframework
    easy_install robotframework

    # Upgrade to the latest version
    pip install --upgrade robotframework
    easy_install --upgrade robotframework

    # Install a specific version
    pip install robotframework==2.7.1
    easy_install robotframework==2.7.1

    # Uninstall -- only supported by pip
    pip uninstall robotframework


.. tip::   If you need to use a proxy to access the Internet, you can use
           :var:`http_proxy` environment variable both with :prog:`pip` and
           :prog:`easy_install`. In addition to that, :prog:`pip` supports
           also :opt:`--proxy` command line option.

.. note::  Both :prog:`pip` and :prog:`easy_install` have a "feature" that
           unless a specific version is given, they install the latest possible
           version even if that is an alpha or beta release. For example, if
           2.7.2 is the latest stable version and there is also 2.8 beta release
           available, running :cli:`pip install robotframework` will install
           the latter. A workaround is giving the version explicitly like in
           :cli:`pip install robotframework==2.7.2`.

.. note::  Only Robot Framework 2.7 and newer support :prog:`pip`.

Using One Click Installer
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

The One Click Installer can install Robot Framework and its preconditions_ Python
and Jython (optional). It also automatically puts Robot Framework
`runner scripts`_ as well as Python and Jython executables into PATH_.

The One Click Installer requires that you have downloaded all the required
component installers separately and have them in the same directory with it.
More detailed instructions and details about the supported installers are
available on `One Click Installer`_ wiki page.

.. note::  One Click Installer works only on Windows XP (32 bit).

.. note::  You should use this installer only if you *do not* previously
           have Python or Jython installed.

Standalone JAR distribution
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework is also distributed as a standalone Java archive that
contains both Jython and Robot Framework and only requires Java_ 5 or newer
as a dependency. It is an easy way to get everything in one package that
requires no installation, but has a downside that it does not work with Python.

The package is named :prog:`robotframework-<version>.jar` and it is available
on the `download page`_ or as a `Maven dependency`__. After downloading the
package, you can execute tests with it like:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  java -jar robotframework-2.7.jar mytests.txt
  java -jar robotframework-2.7.jar --variable name:value mytests.txt

If you want to `post-process outputs`_ or use the `built-in tools`_,
you need to give the command name (e.g. :prog:`rebot` or :prog:`libdoc`) as the
first argument to the JAR file:

.. sourcecode:: bash

  java -jar robotframework-2.7.jar rebot output.xml
  java -jar robotframework-2.7.jar libdoc MyLibrary list

For more information about the different commands, execute the JAR file without
arguments.

__ http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.robotframework%22%20AND%20a%3A%22robotframework%22

Manual installation
'''''''''''''''''''

If you do not want to use any automatic way of installing Robot Framework,
you can always do it manually following these steps:

1. Get the source code. All the code is in a directory (a module in
   Python) called :path:`robot`. If you have a `source distribution`_ or
   a version control checkout, you can find it from the :path:`src`
   directory, but you can also get it from an earlier installation.

2. Copy the source code where you want to.

3. Create `runner scripts`_ you need or use the `direct entry points`_
   with the interpreter of your choice.

Where files are installed
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

When an automatic installer is used, the Robot Framework code is copied
into a directory containing external Python modules. On UNIX-like operating
systems where Python is pre-installed the location of this directory varies.
If you have installed the interpreter yourself, it is normally
:path:`Lib/site-packages` under the interpreter installation directory, for
example, :path:`c:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages`. The actual Robot
Framework code is in a directory named :path:`robot`, or when using `easy_install`_
in directory :path:`robotframework-<version>.py<version>.egg/robot`.

Robot Framework `runner scripts`_ are created and copied into another
platform-specific location. When using Python on UNIX-like systems, they
normally go to :path:`/usr/bin`. On Windows and with other interpreters,
the scripts are typically either in :path:`Scritps` or :path:`bin` directory
under the interpreter installation directory.

Uninstallation and upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uninstallation
''''''''''''''

How to uninstall Robot Framework depends on the original installation method.
Notice that if you have set :var:`PATH` or configured your environment
otherwise, you need to undo these changes separately.

Using source distribution
`````````````````````````

`Source distribution`_ contains a custom :prog:`install.py` script that
also supports uninstallation:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   python install.py uninstall

Uninstallation after using Windows installer
````````````````````````````````````````````

If `Windows installer`_  has been used, the uninstallation can be done
using ``Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs``. Robot Framework is listed
under Python applications.

Using :prog:`pip`
`````````````````

As discussed earlier__, :prog:`pip` package manager supports also
uninstallation:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   pip uninstall robotframework

An especially nice feature of :prog:`pip` is that it can uninstall packages
even if installation has been done using some other approach.

__ `Python package managers`_

Manual uninstallation
`````````````````````

The framework can always be uninstalled manually. This requires removing
:code:`robot` module as well as the created `runner scripts`_ from locations
`where they are installed`__.

__ `Where files are installed`_

Upgrading
'''''''''

When upgrading or downgrading Robot Framework, it is safe to
install a new version over the existing when switching between two
minor versions (e.g. from 2.7 to 2.7.1). This typically works also
when upgrading to a new major version (e.g. from 2.6.3 to 2.7), but
uninstalling the old version is always safer.

A very nice feature of :prog:`pip` package manager is that it automatically
uninstalls old versions when upgrading. This happens both when changing to
a specific version or when upgrading to the latest version:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   pip install robotframework==2.7.1
   pip install --upgrade robotframework

The custom :prog:`install.py` script included in the `source distribution`_
also supports re-installation that automatically removes the old installation first:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   python install.py reinstall

Regardless on the version and installation method, you do not need to
reinstall preconditions or set :var:`PATH` environment variable again.
