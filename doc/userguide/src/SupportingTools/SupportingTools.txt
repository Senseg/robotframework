Library documentation tool
--------------------------

`libdoc.py`_ is tool for generating HTML or XML documentation from keywords of
a test library or a resource file. It is included in the source distribution
and also available through
http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/SupportingTools.


Test data tidying tool
----------------------

This tool can be used to clean up and change format of Robot Framework test
data files. By default, the output is written to the standard output stream,
but it can be redirected to a file. Alternatively, files can be modified
in-place using :opt:`--inplace` or :opt:`--recursive` options.

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

::

    python -m robot.tidy [options] inputfile
    python -m robot.tidy [options] inputfile > outputfile
    python -m robot.tidy --inplace [options] inputfile [more input files]
    python -m robot.tidy --recursive [options] directory

Options
~~~~~~~

 -i, --inplace    Tidy given file(s) so that original file(s) are overwritten
                  (or removed, if the format is changed). When this option is
                  used, it is possible to give multiple input files. Examples::

                      python -m robot.tidy --inplace tests.html
                      python -m robot.tidy --inplace --format txt *.html

 -r, --recursive  Process given directory recursively. Files in the directory
                  are processed in place similarly as when :opt:`--inplace`
                  option is used.
 -f, --format <txt|html|tsv>
                  Output file format. If omitted, the format of the input
                  file is used.
 -p, --use-pipes  Use a pipe character (|) as a cell separator in the txt format.
 -h, --help       Show this help.

Cleaning up the test data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test case files created with HTML editors or written by hand can be normalized
using tidy. Tidy always writes consistent headers, consistent order for
settings, and consistent amount of whitespace between cells and tables.

Examples::

  python -m robot.tidy messed_up_tests.html > cleaned_tests.html
  python -m robot.tidy --inplace tests.txt

Changing test data format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework supports test data in HTML, TSV and TXT formats and this tool
makes changing between the formats trivial. Input format is always determined
based on the extension of the input file. Output format can be set using
the :opt:`--format` option.

Examples::

  python -m robot.tidy --format tsv tests_in_html.html > tests_in_tsv.tsv
  python -m robot.tidy --format txt --recursive mytests

Output encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All output files are written using UTF-8 encoding. Outputs written to the
console use the current console encoding.


Test data editing tool (RIDE)
-----------------------------

RIDE is a standalone tool for editing test data. It helps in
creating, editing and maintaining of Robot Framework test data.
The project pages are at https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/.
