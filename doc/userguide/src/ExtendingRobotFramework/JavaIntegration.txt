Using Robot Framework from Java
-------------------------------

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5.2 Robot Framework is also distributed as a
standalone jar file that contains both Jython and Robot Framework.  This allows
`command line execution`__ with only Java installed, but the jar file also
provides an API for Java usage. The current API documentation is available
online__.

__ `Starting test execution`_

Running tests via the API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simple code below demonstrates how Robot Framework test execution can be
started from a Java program:

.. sourcecode:: java

    import org.robotframework.RobotFramework;

    public class Test {

        public void runTests() {
            int rc = RobotFramework.run(new String[] { "--outputdir", "/tmp", "mytests" });
            if (rc == 0)
                System.out.println("All tests passed");
            else if (rc <= 250)
                System.out.println(rc + " tests failed.");
            else
                System.out.println("Error occurred");
        }

    }

Return value of :code:`RobotFramework.run` has same meaning as `return code`_ of
Robot Framework execution.
