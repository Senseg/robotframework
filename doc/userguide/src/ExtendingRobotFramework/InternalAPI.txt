Using internal APIs
-------------------

Robot Framework has some public APIs which are intended to help in developing 
supporting tools or extending the processing of input or output data. These
APIs are implemented as Python modules, and as such can only be used from 
Python and Jython scripts and programs. 

Unfortunately, these APIs are not particularly well documented, and
are subject to change and refinement in the future. The plan is to
enhance the documentation in the future, but before that the options for getting
more information are asking help from Robot Framework developers,
investigating existing `supporting tools`_ that use these APIs, or
just taking a look at the source code of Robot Framework.

Executed test data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This API consists of a factory method for reading a Robot Framework
output file into a :code:`TestSuite` object that contains all the
relevant information about the results of the test execution.
Signature of method is :code:`TestSuite(outpath)`, where
:code:`outpath` is a path to an existing output file. The returned
:code:`TestSuite` object can be used to process the results of the
test run.

Here is an example that reads a given output file and marks each test case whose 
execution time is longer than three minutes failed. The :code:`TestSuite` object 
is then serialized and normal log and report files could be generated with 
:prog:`rebot`.

.. sourcecode:: python 
   
   src/ExtendingRobotFramework/check_test_times.py


Test execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This API consists of :code:`run` method, which can be used for starting the 
test execution. Signature of the method is :code:`run(*datasources, **options)`, 
where :code:`datasources` are paths to files and directories to be executed and
:code:`options` are same as normal `command line options`_ without hyphens.

.. sourcecode:: python

    from robot import run

    run('tests.html', log='mylog.html', include=['tag1', 'tag2'])

Equivalent command line usage would be::

   pybot --log mylog.html --include tag1 --include tag2 tests.html

.. warning:: This method can be used only once in a given context. 
             This problem will be fixed in future releases.


Parsed test data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This API consists of a factory method for getting a :code:`TestSuite`
object that contains parsed test data. The method is used like
:code:`TestSuite(*datasources)`, where :code:`datasources` are paths to
files and directories containing the test data:

.. sourcecode:: python

    from robot.parsing import TestSuite
    
    suite = TestSuite('path/to/tests.html')
    print suite.name
    for test in suite.tests:
        print test.name


Runnable test data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This API consists of a factory method for parsing given input files
into a runnable :code:`TestSuite` object. The signature of this
:code:`robot.running.TestSuite` method is
:code:`TestSuite(datasources, settings)`, where data sources are paths
to files and directories similarly as when executing tests from the
command line.


Configuring logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework has a global logger that is responsible for error
reporting and logging in general. This :code:`LOGGER` instance is a
proxy and it is possible to register new loggers to it. Registered
loggers get notifications when something happends and they can report
events however they want. A console logger writing warnings and errors
into the standard error stream is registered automatically but it can
be disabled. For more information about how to register loggers and
what methods loggers can implement, see the source code and
documentation of :code:`robot.output.LOGGER`.
