Documentation formatting
------------------------

It is possible to use simple HTML formatting with `test suite`__,
`test case`__ and `user keyword`__ documentation in the test data, as well
as when `documenting test libraries`__.  The formatting is similar to
the style used in most wikis, and it is designed to be understandable
both as plain text and after the HTML transformation.

__ `test case documentation`_
__ `user keyword documentation`_
__ `Documenting libraries`_

Representing newlines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation used for test suites, test cases and keywords is
subject to `general parsing rules`__ of the test data. This means that
normal newlines are not preserved, and dividing documentation into lines
and paragraphs requires using a `literal newline character sequence`__
(:code:`\\n`), as illustrated in the example below.

__ `Test data syntax`_
__ `Handling whitespace`_

.. raw:: html

   <table class="example docutils">
     <tr>
       <th>Setting</th>
       <th>Value</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Documentation</td>
       <td>
         First line.\n<br>\n<br>
         Second paragraph, this time\n<br>with multiple lines.
       </td>
     </tr>
   </table>

With library documentations normal newlines are enough, and for
example the following keyword documentation would create same end result
as the above test suite documentation.

.. sourcecode:: python

  def example_keyword():
      """First line.

      Second paragraph, this time
      with multiple lines.
      """
      pass

Bold and italic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bold text can be created by having an asterisk before and after the
selected word or words, for example :code:`\*this is bold*`. Italic
style works similarly, but the special character to use is an
underscore, for example :code:`\_italic_`. It is also possible to have
bold italic with the syntax :code:`\_*bold italic*_`.

An asterisk or an underscore alone, or in the middle of a word, does
not start formatting, but punctuation characters before or after them
are allowed. Both bold and italic are limited for formatting text on
one line, and formatting spanning several lines must be explicitly
started and stopped on every line.

.. raw:: html

   <table class="tabular docutils">
     <caption>Bold and italic examples</caption>
     <tr>
       <th>Unformatted</th>
       <th>Formatted</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>*bold*</td>
       <td><b>bold</b></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>_italic_</td>
       <td><i>italic</i></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>*bold* and then _italic_</td>
       <td><b>bold</b> and then <i>italic</i></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>_*bold italic*_, _italic_, nothing</td>
       <td><i><b>bold italic</b></i>, <i>italic</i>, nothing</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>This is *bold*\n<br>*on multiple*\n<br>*lines*.</td>
       <td>This is <b>bold</b><br><b>on multiple</b><br><b>lines</b>.</td>
     </tr>
   </table>

URLs
~~~~

All strings that look like URLs are automatically converted into
clickable links. Additionally, URLs that end with extension
:path:`.jpg`, :path:`.jpeg`, :path:`.png`, :path:`.gif` or
:path:`.bmp` (case-insensitive) will automatically create images. For
example URLs like :code:`http://some.url` are turned into links, and
:code:`http:///server/image.jpg` and :code:`file:///path/chart.png`
into images.

The automatic conversion of URLs to links is applied to all the data
in logs and reports, but creating images is done only for test suite,
test case and keyword documentation.

Tables
~~~~~~

Tables are created using the pipe character with whitespace around it
as a cell boundary and the newline as a row separator. In library
documentations normal newlines are enough, but in test suite, test
case and keyword documentations the explicit newline character
sequence (:code:`\\n`) is needed::

   | *A*  | *B*   | *C*   |\n
   | _1_  | Hello | world |\n
   | _2_  | Hi    |       |\n

The created table always has a thin border and the text is
left-aligned. Formatting using bold and italic works also in table
cells, so it is possible to create headers. For example the above
documentation would be formatted like this:

.. table::
   :class: tabular

   ========  ========  ========
   **A**     **B**     **C**
   *1*       Hello     world
   *2*       Hi
   ========  ========  ========

Preformatted text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from Robot Framework 2.7, it is also possible to embed blocks of
preformatted text in the documentation. Preformatted block is created by
starting lines with '| ', one space being mandatory after the pipe character.
The sequence '| ' will be removed from the resulting HTML, but all other
whitespace is preserved.

In the following documentation, the two middle lines form a preformatted
block when converted to HTML::

  Doc before block:\n
  | inside block\n
  |    some   additional whitespace\n
  After block


Horizontal ruler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Horizontal rulers (the <hr> tag) make it possible to separate larger
sections from each others, and they can be created by having three
hyphens alone in a line. With documentations in the test data literal
newlines are, again, required::

   Some text here.\n
   \n
   ---\n
   \n
   More text...
