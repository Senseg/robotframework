Documentation formatting
------------------------

It is possible to use simple HTML formatting, such as bold and italic
text and tables, both with the documentation of test cases and test
suites and in the library documentation. The formatting is designed so
that it is understandable and clear both as plain text and after the
HTML transformation. It is also similar to the style used in most
wikis.

Applicable general rules on documentation formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

Besides the formatting explained here, the documentation used for test
cases and suites is subject to `general parsing rules`_ of the Robot
Framework test data. For example, dividing text into lines and
paragraphs requires having a literal newline character sequence
(:code:`\\n`), as illustrated in the example below.

.. raw:: html

   <table class="example docutils">
     <tr>
       <th>Setting</th>
       <th>Value</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Documentation</td>
       <td>First line.\n<br>Second line.\n<br>\n<br>Second paragraph.</td>
     </tr>
   </table>


Furthermore, a very long documentation can also be `split into several
rows`_ using :code:`...`.


Bold and italic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Bold text can be created by having an asterisk before and after the
selected word or words, for example :code:`\*this is bold*`. Italic
style works similarly, but the special character is an underscore, for
example :code:`\_italic_`. An asterisk or an underscore alone or in
the middle of a word does not start bold or italic, but punctuation
marks before them, and after the closing asterisk or underscore, are
allowed. Both bold and italic are limited for formatting text on one
line, and formatting spanning several lines must be explicitly
restarted and stopped on every line.

It is also possible to have bold italic with the syntax :code:`\_*bold
italic*_`. Note that in this syntax, underscores must always be outside
asterisks.

Examples:

.. raw:: html

   <table class="tabular docutils">
     <tr>
       <th>Unformatted</th>
       <th>Formatted</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>*bold*</td>
       <td><b>bold</b></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>_italic_</td>
       <td><i>italic</i></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>*bold* and then _italic_</td>
       <td><b>bold</b> and then <i>italic</i></td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>_*bold italic*_, _italic_, nothing</td>
       <td><i><b>bold italic</b></i>, <i>italic</i>, nothing</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>This is *bold*\n<br>*on multiple*\n<br>*lines*.</td>
       <td>This is <b>bold</b><br><b>on multiple</b><br><b>lines</b>.</td>
     </tr>
   </table>


URLs
~~~~ 

All strings that look like URLs are automatically converted into a
clickable link. For example, :code:`http://some.url` turns into link.


Tables
~~~~~~ 

Tables are created using the pipe character with spaces around it ( | ) as
a cell boundary and a newline (:code:`\\n`) as a row separator. The table
always has a thin border and the text is left-aligned. Formatting using
bold and italic works also in table cells::

   | *xx* | *yy*  | *zz*  | \n
   | _1_  | Hello | world | \n
   | _2_  | Hi    |       | \n

.. table:: An example table
   :class: tabular

   ========  ========  ========
      xx        yy        zz
   ========  ========  ========
   *1*       Hello     world
   *2*       Hi        \
   ========  ========  ========


Horizontal ruler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Horizontal rulers (the <hr> tag) make it possible to separate larger
sections from each others. They can be created by having three hyphens
alone in a line (:code:`\\n---\\n`). Example::

   Some text here.\n
    \n
    ---\n
    \n
   More text...
