                          anything) and "?" (matches any char). In case of 
                          multiple matches, documentations are catenated with
                          spaces. The documentation can contain formatting, as with

Rebot command line options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Options:

  -N, --name <name>       Sets the name of the top level test suite. The name is
                          automatically capitalized and underscores converted
                          to spaces.
  -D, --doc <document>    Sets the document of the top-level test suite.
                          Underscores in the document are turned into spaces.
                          The document may also contain simple HTML formatting 
                          (for example, \*bold\*, _italic_ and http://url/).
  -M, --metadata <name:value>  Sets the metadata of the top-level test suite. The 
                          name is automatically capitalized and underscores converted
                          to spaces. The value can contain the same HTML formatting as
                          --doc. 
  -G, --settag <tag>      Sets the given tag(s) to all executed test cases. 
  -t, --test <name>       Selects test cases by name. The name is case- and space-
                          insensitive. It can also be a simple pattern, where
                          "\*" matches anything and "?" matches any character.
  -s, --suite <name>        Selects test suites by name. When this option is used
                          with --test, --include or --exclude, only test cases
                          in matching suites and also matching the other filtering
                          criteria are selected. 
  -i, --include <tag>     Selects test cases by tag. Similarly as the name in --test,
                          the tag is case- and space-insensitive and can also be
                          a simple pattern. To include only tests that have 
                          more than one tag, use "&" or "AND" between the tag names.
  -e, --exclude <tag>     Unselects test cases by tag. These tests are not
                          selected, even if they are included with --include.
                          Tag names are handled similarly as in --include, and
                          excluding only tests containing multiple tags works
                          the same way using "&" or "AND".
  -c, --critical <tag>    Tests that have the given tag are considered critical. 
                          If no critical tags are set, all tags are critical. 
                          Tags can be given as a pattern, for example, with --test.
                          Resets possible critical tags set earlier.
  -n, --noncritical <tag>  Tests that have the given tag are not critical, even if they
                          have a tag set with --critical. The tag can be a pattern.
                          Resets possible non-critical tags set earlier.
  -d, --outputdir <dir>   Defines where to create output files. The default is the
                          directory where Rebot is run from, and the given path
                          is considered relative to that, unless it is absolute.
  -o, --output <file>     The XML output file. Not created unless this option is
                          specified. The given path, similarly as paths given to
                          --log, --report and --summary, is relative to
                          --outputdir, unless given as an absolute path.
                          The default is "output.xml". 
  -l, --log <file>        The HTML log file. Can be disabled by giving a special
                          name "NONE". 
  -r, --report <file>     The HTML report file. Can be disabled with "NONE"
                          similarly as --log. Default is "report.html".
  -S, --summary <file>    The HTML summary report. Not created unless this option
                          is specified. 
  -T, --timestampoutputs  When this option is used, timestamp in a format
                          "YYYYMMDD-hhmmss" is added to all generated output 
                          files between their basename and extension.
  --splitoutputs <level>  Splits output and log files from a specified suite 
                          level to make them smaller. Top-level files
                          have links to lower-level files for easy navigation.
  --logtitle <title>    The title for the generated test log. The default title
                          is "<Name Of The Suite> Test Log". Underscores in
                          the title are converted into spaces in all titles.
  --reporttitle <title>  The title for the generated test report. The default
                          title is "<Name Of The Suite> Test Report".
  --summarytitle <title>  The title for the generated summary report. The default
                          title is "<Name Of The Suite> Summary Report".
  --suitestatlevel <level>  Defines how many levels to show in the Statistics by Suite
                          table in outputs. By default, all suite levels are
                          shown. If zero (0) is given, the whole table is 
                          removed. Example: "--suitestatlevel 3".
  --tagstatinclude <tag>  Includes only these tags in the Statistics by Tag and
                          Test Details by Tag tables in outputs. By default,
                          all tags set in test cases are shown. The given
                          tag can also be a simple pattern (see for example --test).
  --tagstatexclude <tag>  Excludes these tags from the Statistics by Tag and
                          Test Details by Tag tables in outputs. This option
                          can be used with --tagstatinclude, similarly as
                          --exclude is used with --include.
  --tagstatcombine <tags>  Creates combined statistics based on tags. These
                          statistics are added into the Statistics by Tag table 
                          and matching tests into the Test Details by Tag table.
                          There are three ways to give these tags.
                          1) One tag as a simple pattern. Tests having a tag
                          matching the pattern are included. Example: "it-\*".
                          2) Two or more tags (or patterns) separated by "&" or
                          "AND". Only tests having all these tags are included.
                          3) Two or more tags (or patterns) separated by "NOT".
                          Tests having the first tag but not any of the latter
                          ones are included. Example: "it-10NOTsmoke"
  --tagdoc <pattern:doc>  Add documentation to tags matching given pattern. 
                          Documentation is shown in the Test Details by Tag 
                          table and also as a tooltip in the Statistics by Tag 
                          table. Pattern can contain characters "\*" (matches 
                          anything) and "?" (matches any char). In case of 
                          multiple matches, documentations are catenated with
                          spaces. Documentation can contain formatting as with
                          --doc option.
  --tagstatlink <pattern:link:title>  Adds links into the Statistics by Tag 
                          table in outputs. Pattern can contain the characters  
                          "\*"(matches anything) and "?" (matches any character).
                          Character(s) matching to wildcard expression(s) can 
                          be used in the resulting link with the syntax "%N", where N
                          is the index of the match (starting from 1). In the title,
                          underscores are automatically converted to spaces.
  --removekeywords <all|passed>  Removes keyword data from generated outputs. 
                          Keyword data is not needed when creating reports, and
                          removing it can decrease the size of an output file
                          considerably.
                          "all"    - remove data from all keywords
                          "passed" - remove data only from keywords in passed
                          test cases and suites
  --starttime <timestamp>  Sets the starting time of test execution when creating
                          combined reports. The timestamp must be given in the format
                          "2007-10-01 15:12:42.268", where all separators are optional 
                          (for example, "20071001151242268" is acceptable, too), 
                          and the parts from milliseconds to hours can be omitted, if
                          they are zero (for example, 2007-10-01). If this option is
                          not used, the starttime of combined reports is "N/A".
  --endtime <timestamp>   The same as --starttime, but for ending time. If both 
                          the options are used, the elapsed time is calculated based 
                          on them. Otherwise it is calculated by adding the elapsed 
                          times of sub tests suites together.
  -E, --escape <what:with>  Escapes characters that are problematic in the console.
                          "what" is the name of the character to escape and
                          "with" is the string to escape it with. Note that
                          all the given arguments, including data sources, are escaped,
                          so escape characters need to be selected carefully.
                          The available escapes: amp (&), apos ('), at (@), bslash
                          (\), colon (:), comma (,), curly1 ({), curly2 (}),
                          dollar ($), exclam (!), gt (>), hash (#), lt (<),
                          paren1 ((), paren2 ()), percent (%), pipe (|), quest
                          (?), quot ("), semic (;), slash (/), space ( ),
                          square1 ([), square2 (]), star (\*)
  -A, --argumentfile <path>   The text file to read more arguments from. The file can 
                          have both options and data sources one per line. Contents
                          do not need to be escaped, but spaces in the beginning
                          and end of lines are removed. Empty lines and lines
                          starting with a hash character (#) are ignored.
  -h, --help              Prints usage instructions.
  --version               Prints version information.


Environment Variables:

ROBOT_SYSLOG_FILE         The path to the syslog file. If not specified, or set to
                          a special value "NONE", writing to syslog file is 
                          disabled. The path must be absolute. 
ROBOT_SYSLOG_LEVEL        The log level to use when writing to the syslog file.
                          The available levels are the same as for the --loglevel 
                          option to Robot and the default is INFO.
