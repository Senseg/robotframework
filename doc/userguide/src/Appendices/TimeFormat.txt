Robot Framework time formats
----------------------------

In this appendix, the syntax for specifying time in Robot Framework is
described. It can be used with test case and user keyword timeouts, as
well as with several keywords, for example with the BuiltIn library's
keywords :kw:`Sleep` and :kw:`Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`.

It is possible to give the time as a number (not necessarily an
integer), or as a string that is converted to a number and then
considered to be seconds (for example, 10, 0.5, or 42). The given time
must be in the format "2 days 3 hours 4 minutes 5 seconds 6
milliseconds" following the rules listed below:
    
    - Digits with a zero value can be ignored (for example, "1 minute"
      and "2 minutes 10 seconds" are valid).
    - The format is case- and space-insensitive. Thus valid are all of the formats below:

      + "days", "day", and "d"
      + "hours", "hour", and "h"
      + "minutes", "minute", "mins", "min", and "m"
      + "seconds", "second", "secs", "sec", and "s"
      + "milliseconds", "millisecond", "millis", and "ms"
