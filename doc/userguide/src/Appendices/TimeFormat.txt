Time format
-----------

Robot Framework has its own time format that is used by several
keywords (for example :name:`Sleep` and :name:`Wait Until Keyword
Succeeds`) as well as `test case`__ and `user keyword timeouts`_. This
format is meant to be both flexible to use and easy to understand.

__ `test case timeouts`_


Time as number
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time can always be given as a plain number, in which case it is
interpreted to be seconds. Both integers and floating point numbers
work, and it is possible to use either real numbers or strings
containing numerical values. This format is useful, for example, when
the actual time value is calculated.


Time as text
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Representing the time as text means using a format such as :code:`2 minutes
42 seconds`, which is normally easier to understand than just having
the value as seconds. It is, for example, not so easy to understand
how long a time :code:`4200` is in seconds, but :code:`1 hour 10
minutes` is clear immediately.

The basic idea of this format is having first a number and then a text
specifying what time that number represents. Numbers can be either
integers or floating point numbers, the whole format is case and space
insensitive, and the available specifier texts are:

* days, day, d
* hours, hour, h
* minutes, minute, mins, min, m
* seconds, second, secs, sec, s
* milliseconds, millisecond, millis, ms

Examples::

   1 min 30 secs
   1.5 minutes
   90 s
   1 day 2 hours 3 minutes 4 seconds 5 milliseconds
   1d 2h 3m 4s 5ms
