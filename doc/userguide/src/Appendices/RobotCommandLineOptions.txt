Robot command line options
--------------------------

  -N, --name <name>       Sets the name of the top-level test suite. The name is
                          automatically capitalized and underscores converted
                          to spaces. The default name is created from the name of
                          the executed data source.
  -D, --doc <document>    Sets the document of the top-level test suite.
                          Underscores in the document are turned into spaces.
                          The document may also contain simple HTML formatting 
                          (for example, \*bold\* and http://url/).
  -M, --metadata <name:value>  Sets the metadata of the top level test suite. The 
                          name is automatically capitalized and underscores converted
                          to spaces. The value can contain the same HTML formatting as
                          --doc.
  -G, --settag <tag>      Sets the given tag(s) to all executed test cases. 
  -t, --test <name>       Selects test cases to run by name. The name is case- and
                          space-insensitive and can also be a simple pattern,
                          where "\*" matches anything and "?" matches any char.
                          If using "\*" amd "?" in the console is problematic,
                          see  --escape and --argumentfile.
  -s, --suite <name>      Selects test suites to run by name. When this option
                          is used with  --test, --include or --exclude, only
                          test cases in matching suites and also matching the other
                          filtering criteria are selected. The name can be a simple
                          pattern similarly as with  --test, and it can contain
                          the parent name separated with a dot. 
  -i, --include <tag>     Selects test cases to run by tag. Similarly as the name in
                          --test, the tag is case- and space-insensitive and 
                          can also be a simple pattern. To include only tests
                          that have more than one tag, use "&" or "AND" between
                          tag names. 
  -e, --exclude <tag>     Selects test cases not to run by tag. These tests are
                          not run, even if they are included with  --include. The tag
                          names are handled similarly as in  --include, and
                          excluding only tests containing multiple tags works
                          the same way using "&" or "AND".
  -c, --critical <tag>    Tests that have the given tag are considered critical. If no
                          critical tags are set, all tags are critical. The tags
                          can be given as a pattern, for example, with  --test.
  -n, --noncritical <tag>  Tests that have the given tag are not critical, even if they 
                          have a tag set with  --critical. The tag can be a pattern.
  --runmode <mode>        The possible values are "random:test", "random:suite",  
                          "random:all" and "exitonfailure". Any other value is 
                          ignored. The first three change the execution order of 
                          suites or tests (or both). "exitonfailure" causes the
                          execution of tests to be stopped, if a critical test
                          fails.  
  -v, --variable <name:value>   Sets variables in the test data. Only scalar
                          variables are supported, and the name is given without 
                          "${}". See  --escape for how to use special characters
                          and  --variablefile for a more powerful variable
                          setting mechanism that allows also list variables.
  -V, --variablefile <path>  The file to read variables from (for example, 
                          "path/vars.py").
  -d, --outputdir <dir>   Defines where to create output files. The default is the
                          directory where tests are run from, and the given path
                          is considered relative to that, unless it is absolute.
  -o, --output <file>     The XML output file. The given path, similarly as paths given
                          to  --log, --report, --summary and --debugfile, is 
                          relative to  --outputdir, unless given as an absolute 
                          path. Other output files are created from the XML output 
                          file after the test execution, and XML output can also
                          be further processed with the Rebot tool (for example, combined 
                          with other XML output files). The default is "output.xml".
  -l, --log <file>        The HTML log file. Can be disabled by giving a special
                          name "NONE". The default is "log.html".
  -r, --report <file>     The HTML report file. Can be disabled with "NONE",
                          similarly as  --log. The default is "report.html".
  -S, --summary <file>    The HTML summary report. Not created, unless this option
                          is specified.
  -b, --debugfile <file>  The debug file that is written during execution. Not created, 
                          unless this option is specified.
  -T, --timestampoutputs  When this option is used, a timestamp in a format
                          "YYYYMMDD-hhmmss" is added to all generated output 
                          files between their basename and extension.
  --splitoutputs <level>  Splits output and log files from the specified suite
                          level. Decreases the size of generated files and lower
                          level files that are available immediately after the relevant
                          test suite is executed. Top-level files have links to
                          lower-level files for easy navigation. 
  --logtitle <title>      The title for the generated test log. The default title
                          is "<Name Of The Suite> Test Log". Underscores in
                          the title are converted into spaces in all titles.
  --reporttitle <title>   The title for the generated test report. The default
                          title is "<Name Of The Suite> Test Report".
  --summarytitle <title>  The title for the generated summary report. The default
                          title is "<Name Of The Suite> Summary Report".
  -L, --loglevel <level>  The threshold level for logging. The available levels: 
                          TRACE, DEBUG, INFO (default), WARN, NONE (no logging).
  --suitestatlevel <level>  Defines how many levels to show in the Statistics by Suite
                          table in outputs. By default, all suite levels are
                          shown. If zero (0) is given, the whole table is 
                          removed.
  --tagstatinclude <tag>  Includes only these tags in the Statistics by Tag and
                          Test Details by Tag tables in outputs. By default,
                          all tags set in test cases are shown. The given
                          tag can also be a simple pattern (see for example --test).
  --tagstatexclude <tag>  Excludes these tags from the Statistics by Tag and
                          Test Details by Tag tables in outputs. This option
                          can be used with  --tagstatinclude similarly as
                          --exclude is used with --include.
  --tagstatcombine <tags>  Creates combined statistics based on tags. These
                          statistics are added into the Statistics by Tag table 
                          and matching tests into the Test Details by Tag table.
                          There are three ways to give these tags:
                          1) One tag as a simple pattern. Tests having a tag
                          matching the pattern are included.
                          2) Two or more tags (or patterns) separated by "&" or
                          "AND". Only tests having all these tags are included.
                          3) Two or more tags (or patterns) separated by "NOT".
                          Tests having the first tag, but not any of the latter
                          ones, are included.
  --tagdoc <pattern:doc>   Adds documentation to tags matching the given pattern. 
                          Documentation is shown in the Test Details by Tag 
                          table and also as a tooltip in the Statistics by Tag 
                          table. The pattern can contain the characters "\*" (matches 
                          anything) and "?" (matches any char). In case of 
                          multiple matches, documentations are catenated with
                          spaces. The documentation can contain formatting, as with
                          the --doc <option.
  --tagstatlink <pattern:link:title>   Adds external links to the Statistics by 
                          Tag table in outputs. The pattern can contain the characters
                          "\*" (matches anything) and "?" (matches any char).
                          Character(s) matching to wildcard expression(s) can 
                          be used in the resulting link with the syntax "%N", where N
                          is the index of the match (starting from 1). In the title,
                          underscores are automatically converted to spaces.
  --listener <class>      A class for monitoring test execution. Gets 
                          notifications, for example,  when a test case starts and ends.
  -W, --monitorwidth <chars>  The width of the monitor output. The default is 78.
  -C, --monitorcolors <on|off|force>  Using ANSI colors in the console. Normally, colors
                          work in UNIX-like operating systems, but not in Windows. The 
                          default is "on".                          
                          'on'    - use colors in unixes but not in Windows
                          'off'   - never use colors
                          'force' - always use colors (also in Windows)
  -P, --pythonpath <path>   Additional locations (directories, ZIPs, JARs) where
                          to search test libraries from when they are imported.
                          Multiple paths can be given by separating them with a
                          colon (:) or using this option several times. The given
                          path can also be a glob pattern matching multiple
                          paths, but then it normally must be escaped or quoted.
  -E, --escape <what:with>   Escape characters that are problematic in the console.
                          "what" is the name of the character to escape and
                          "with" is the string to escape it with. Note that
                          all given arguments, including data sources, are escaped,
                          so escape characters need to be selected carefully.
                          The available escapes: amp (&), apos ('), at (@), bslash
                          (\), colon (:), comma (,), curly1 ({), curly2 (}),
                          dollar ($), exclam (!), gt (>), hash (#), lt (<),
                          paren1 ((), paren2 ()), percent (%), pipe (|), quest
                          (?), quot ("), semic (;), slash (/), space ( ),
                          square1 ([), square2 (]), star (*).
  -A, --argumentfile <path>   The text file to read more arguments from. The file can 
                          have both options and data sources one per line. The contents
                          need not be escaped, but spaces in the beginning
                          and end of lines are removed. Empty lines and lines
                          starting with a hash character (#) are ignored.
  -h, --help              Prints usage instructions.
  --version               Prints version information.

Environment Variables:

ROBOT_SYSLOG_FILE         The path to the syslog file. If not specified, or set to
                          the special value "NONE", writing to syslog file is 
                          disabled. The path must be absolute. 
ROBOT_SYSLOG_LEVEL        The log level to use when writing to the syslog file.
                          The available levels are the same as for the  --loglevel
                          option. The default is INFO.
