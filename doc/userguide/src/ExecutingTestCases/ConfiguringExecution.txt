Configuring execution
----------------------

This section explains different command line options that can be used
configuring the `test execution`_ or `post-processing outputs`_
somehow. Options related to generated output files are discussed in the `next section`__.

Selecting test cases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework offers several command line options for selecting
which test cases to execute. Same options also work when
post-processing outputs with :prog:`rebot` tool.


By test suite and test case names
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Test suites and test cases can be selected by their names with command
line options :setting:`--suite (-s)` and :setting:`--test (-t)`,
respectively.  Both of these options can be used multiple times to
select multiple test suites or cases. Arguments to these options are
case and space insensitive, and there can also be `simple
patterns`_ matching multiple names.  If both :setting:`--suite` and
:setting:`--test` options are used, only test cases in matching suites
with matching names are selected.

::

  --test Example
  --test mytest --test yourtest
  --test example*
  --suite example-??
  --suite mysuite --test mytest --test your*

Using :setting:`--suite` option is more or less same as executing only
the appropriate test case file or directory. One major benefit is the
possibility to select the suite based on its parent suite. The syntax
for this is specifying both the parent and child suite names separated
with a dot.  In this case possible setup and teardown of the parent
suite are executed.

::

  --suite parent.child
  --suite myhouse.myhousemusic --test jack*

Selecting individual test cases with :setting:`--test` option is very
handy when creating test cases, but quite limited when running tests
automatically. :setting:`--suite` option can be useful also in that
case, but in general selecting test cases by tag names is more
flexible.

By tag names
''''''''''''

It is possible to include and exclude test cases by tag_ names with
:setting:`--include (-i)` and :setting:`--exclude (-e)` options,
respectively. When the former is used, only test cases having a
matching tag are selected, and with the latter test cases having a
matching tag are not. If both are used, only tests having a tag
matching the former option, and not having a tag matching the latter
are selected.

::

   --include example
   --exclude not_ready
   --include regression --exclude long_lasting

Both :setting:`--include` and :setting:`--exclude` can be used several
times to match multiple tags, and their arguments can be `simple
patterns`_. In these cases the rules for selecting test cases apply so
that test cases having any tag matching any include patterns are
selected, and tests having any tag matching exclude patterns are not.
It is also possible to select only test cases that have two or more
specified tags by separating tags either with :code:`&` or :code:`AND`
(case-sensitive). Similarly only tests with a certain tag but without
another can be selected by separating these tags with :code:`NOT`
(case-sensitive).

::

  --include req-*
  --include regressionANDiter-42
  --include tag1&tag2&tag3&tag4
  --exclude regressionNOTowner-*

Selecting test cases by tags is a very flexible mechanism and allows
many interesting possibilities:

- A subset of tests to be executed before other tests can be tagged
  with :setting:`smoke` and executed with :cli:`--include smoke`.

- Unfinished test can be committed to version control with a tag
  :setting:`not_ready` and excluded from the test execution with
  :cli:`--exclude not_ready`.

- Tests can be tagged with :setting:`iter-<num>`, where
  :setting:`<num>` specifies the number of the current iteration, and
  after executing all test cases a separate report containing only
  tests for certain iteration can be generated like :cli:`rebot
  --include iter-42 ouput.xml`.


Setting criticality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final result of test execution is determined on the basis of
critical tests. If a single critical test fails, the whole test run is
considered failed. Non-critical test cases, on the other hand, can
fail without the overall status is still passed.

By default all test cases are critical, but this can be changed with
:setting:`--critical (-c)` and :setting:`--noncritical (-n)`
options. These options specify which test cases are consider critical
based on tags, similarly as :setting:`--include` and
:setting:`--exclude` are used to `select test cases by tag
names`__. If only :setting:`--critical` is used, test cases having a
matching tag are critical. If only :setting:`--noncritical` is used,
test not having a matching tag are critical. Finally, if both are
used, only test with a critical tag but without a non-critical tag are
considered critical.  Both of these options accept `simple patterns`_
and can be given multiple times.

__ `By tag names`_

::

  --critical regression
  --noncritical not_ready
  --critical iter-* --critical req-* --noncritical req-6??

The most common use case for setting criticality is having test cases
that are not ready or that are testing features still under
development in the test execution. These tests could, of course, be
excluded from the test execution altogether with :setting:`--exclude`
option, but including them as non-critical tests makes it possible to
see when they start to pass.

.. Note:: Currently criticality set when tests are executed is not
          changed when `post-processing outputs`_, unless
          :setting:`--critical` or :setting:`--noncritical` is used
          explicitly. In the future this will change so that they need
          to be used always. It is thus recommended to use them with
          :prog:`rebot` already now.


Setting metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting name
''''''''''''

When Robot Framework parses test data, `test suite names are created
from file and directory names`__. The name of the top-level test suite
can, however, be overridden with the command line option
:setting:`--name (-N)`. Underscores in the given name are converted to
spaces automatically, and words in the name capitalized.

__ `Test suite name and documentation`_


Setting documentation
'''''''''''''''''''''

In addition to `defining documentation in the test data`__, documentation
of the top-level suite can be given from the command line with the
option :setting:`--doc (-D)`. Underscores in the given documentation
are converted to spaces, and it may contain simple `HTML formatting`_.

__ `Test suite name and documentation`_


Setting free metadata
'''''''''''''''''''''

`Free test suite metadata`_ may also be given from the command line
with the option :setting:`--metadata (-M)`. The argument must be in
the format :setting:`name:value`, where :setting:`name` the name of
the metadata to set, and :setting:`value` is its value. Underscores in
the former are converted to spaces and words capitalized, and the
latter may contain simple `HTML formatting`_. This option may be used
several times to set multiple metadata.

Setting tags
''''''''''''

The command line option :setting:`--settag (-G)` can be used to set
the given tag to all executed test cases. This option may be used
several times to set multiple tags.


Adjusting library search path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a `test library is taken into use`__, Robot Framework uses Python
or Jython interpreter to import module implementing the library from
the system. The locations these modules are searched from is called
PYTHONPATH, and when running tests on Jython also Java CLASSPATH is
used.

Adjusting the library search path so that libraries are found is
obviously a requirement for successful test execution. In addition to
find test libraries, the search path is also used to find `listeners
set in the command line`__. There are multiple ways to alter
PYTHONPATH and CLASSPATH, but regardless the selected approach it is
usually best to do it in a `custom start-up script`__.

__ `Setting listeners`_
__ `Creating start-up scripts`_


Locations automatically in PYTHONPATH
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Python and Jython installations put their own library directories into
PYTHONPATH automatically. This means that test libraries `packaged
using Python's own packaging system`__ are automatically installed
into a location that is in the library search path. Robot Framework
also puts the directory containing its `standard libraries`_ and the
directory where tests are executed from into PYTHONPATH.

__ `Packaging libraries`_


Setting PYTHONPATH in system
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

There are several ways to alter PYTHONPATH in the system, but the most
common one is setting an environment variable with the same name
before the test execution. Jython actually does not use PYTHONPATH
environment variable normally, but Robot Framework ensures that
locations listed in it are added into the library search path
regardless the interpreter.


Setting CLASSPATH in system
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

CLASSPATH is used only with Jython, and the most command way to alter
it is setting an environemnt variable similarly as with PYTHONPATH.
Notice that that instead of CLASSPATH it is always possible to use
PYTHONPATH with Jython, even with libraries and listeres implemented
with Java.


Using --pythonpath option
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Robot Framework also has a separate command line option
:setting:`--pythonpath (-P)` for adding directories or archives into
PYTHONPATH. Multiple paths can be given by separating them with a
colon (:), or using this option several times. Given path can also be
a glob pattern matching multiple paths, but then it normally must be
escaped__.

__ `Escaping options`_

Examples::

   --pythonpath libs/ 
   --pythonpath /opt/testlibs:mylibs.zip:yourlibs 
   --pythonpath mylib.jar --pythonpath lib/STAR.jar --escape star:STAR 


Setting variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variables_ can be set from the command line either individually__
using :setting:`--variable (-v)` option or through `variable files`_
with :setting:`--variablefile (-V)` option. Variables and variable
files are explained in separate chapters, but following examples
illustrate how to use these options::

  --variable name:value
  --variable OS:Linux --variable IP:10.0.0.42
  --variablefile path/to/variables.py
  --variable ENVIRONMENT:Windows --variablefile c:\resources\windows.py

__ `Setting variables in command line`_


Setting runmode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a command line option :setting:`--runmode`, which can be used to define
some additional characteristics of the test execution. Currently it has four
meaningful values, all other values are just ignored. The possible values are:

:setting:`random:test`
    Tests inside each suite are executed in random order.

:setting:`random:suite`
    All suites are executed in random order.

:setting:`random:all`
    Suites are executed in random order, tests inside suites likewise.

:setting:`exitonfailure`
    Test execution is stopped whenever a critical test fails. All remaining
    test will be marked failed with the message 
    :msg:`Critical failure occurred and ExitOnFailure option is in use`.


Controlling monitor output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The width of the console output can be defined using the option :setting:`--monitorwidth`.
The default value for the monitor width is 78.

:setting:`--monitorcolors` is used to control whether colors should be used
in the monitor output. It has three possible values, of which :setting:`on` is the
default value:

:setting:`on`
    Colors are used in UNIX-like systems, but not on Windows.

:setting:`off`
    Colors are never used.

:setting:`force`
    Colors are always used.


Setting listeners
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The only way to use a listener__ during execution is to define it from
the command line using the option :setting:`--listener`. The listener
class must be found the `search path`__.

__ `Using the listener interface`_
__ `Adjusting library search path`_


Setting times for combined outputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When combining outputs with rebot, it possible to set the start and end
time of the combined suite using the option :setting:`--starttime` and 
:setting:`--endtime`. This may be convenient, because by default,
these statistics have no value in the combined suite.
