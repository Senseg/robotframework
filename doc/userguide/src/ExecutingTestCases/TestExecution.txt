Test execution
--------------

This section describes how the test suite structure created from the parsed
test data is executed, how to continue executing a test case after failures,
and how to stop the whole test execution gracefully.

Execution flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Executed suites and tests
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Test cases are always executed within a test suite. A test suite
created from a `test case file`_ has tests directly, whereas suites
created from directories__ have child test suites which either have
tests or their own child suites. By default all the tests in an
executed suite are run, but it is possible to `select tests`__ using
options :opt:`--test`, :opt:`--suite`, :opt:`--include` and
:opt:`--exclude`. Suites containing no tests are ignored.

The execution starts from the top-level test suite. If the suite has
tests they are executed one-by-one, and if it has suites they are
executed recursively in depth-first order. When an individual test
case is executed, the keywords it contains are run in a
sequence. Normally the execution of the current test ends if any
of the keywords fails, but it is also possible to 
`continue after failures`__. The exact `execution order`_ and how 
possible `setups and teardowns`_ affect the execution are discussed
in the following sections.

__ `Test suite directories`_
__ `Selecting test cases`_
__ `Continue on failure`_


Setups and teardowns
''''''''''''''''''''

Setups and teardowns can be defined on `test case`__ and `test suite`__ level.

__ `Test setup and teardown`_
__ `Suite setup and teardown`_

Suite setup
```````````

If a test suite has a setup, it is executed before its tests and child
suites. If the suite setup passes, test execution continues
normally. If it fails, all the test cases the suite and its child
suites are marked failed with a message :msg:`Setup of the parent
suite failed.`. The tests and possible suite setups and teardowns in
the child test suites are not executed.

Suite setups are often used for setting up the test environment.
Because tests are not run if the suite setup fails, it is easy to use
suite setups for verifying that the environment is in state in which the
tests can be executed.

Suite teardown
``````````````

If a test suite has a teardown, it is executed after all its test
cases and child suites. Suite teardowns are executed regardless of the
test status and even if the matching suite setup fails. If the suite
teardown fails, all tests in the suite are marked failed afterwards in
reports and logs.

Suite teardowns are mostly used for cleaning up the test environment
after the execution. To ensure that all these tasks are done, `all the
keywords used in the teardown are executed`__ even if some of them
fail.

__ `Continue on failure`_

Test setup
``````````

Possible test setup is executed before the keywords of the test case.
If the setup fails, the keywords are not executed. The main use
for test setups is setting up the environment for that particular test
case.

Test teardown
`````````````

Possible test teardown is executed after the test case has been
executed. It is executed regardless of the test status and also
if the setup of the test has failed.

Similarly as suite teardown, test teardowns are used mainly for
cleanup activities. Also they are executed fully even if some of their
keywords fail.

Execution order
'''''''''''''''

Test cases in a test suite are executed in the same order as they are defined
in the test case file. Test suites inside a higher level test suite are
executed in case-insensitive alphabetical order based on the file or directory
name. If multiple files and/or directories are given from the command line,
they are executed in the order they are given.

If there is a need to use certain test suite execution order inside a
directory, it is possible to add prefixes like :path:`01` and
:path:`02` into file and directory names. Such prefixes are not
included in the generated test suite name if they are separated from
the base name of the suite with two underscores::

   01__my_suite.html -> My Suite
   02__another_suite.html -> Another Suite

If the alphabetical ordering of test suites inside suites is
problematic, a good workaround is giving them separately in the
required order. This easily leads to overly long start-up commands,
but `argument files`_ allow listing files nicely one file per line.

It is also possible to `randomize the execution order`__ using
the :opt:`--runmode` option.

__ `Randomizing execution order`_

Continue on failure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally test cases are stopped immediately when any of their keywords
fail. This behavior shortens test execution time and prevents
subsequent keywords hanging or otherwise causing problems if the
system under test is in unstable state. This has the drawback that often
subsequent keywords would give more information about the state of the
system.

Before Robot Framework 2.5 the only way to handle failures so that
test execution is not terminated immediately was using `BuiltIn
keywords`_ :name:`Run Keyword And Ignore Error` and :name:`Run Keyword
And Expect Error`. Using these keywords for this purpose often added
extra complexity to test cases, and in Robot Framework 2.5 the
following features were added to make continuing after failures
easier.

Special failures from keywords
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

`Library keywords`_ report failures using exceptions, and it is
possible to use special exceptions to tell the core framework that
execution can continue regardless the failure. How these exceptions
can be created is explained in the `test library API chapter`__.

When a test ends and there has been one or more continuable failure,
the test will be marked failed. If there are more than one failure,
all of them will be enumerated in the final error message::

  Several failures occurred:

  1) First error message.

  2) Second error message ...

Test execution ends also if a normal failure occurs after continuable
failures. Also in that case all the failures will be listed in the
final error message.

The return value from failed keywords, possibly assigned to a
variable, is always the Python :code:`None`.

__ `Continuing test execution despite of failures`_

:name:`Run Keyword And Continue On Failure` keyword
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

`BuiltIn keyword`_ :name:`Run Keyword And Continue On Failure` allows
converting any failure into a continuable failure. These failures are
handled by the framework exactly the same way as continuable failures
originating from library keywords.

Execution continues on teardowns automatically
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

To make it sure that all the cleanup activities are taken care of, the
continue on failure mode is automatically on in `test and suite
teardowns`__. In practice this means that in teardowns all the
keywords in all levels are always executed.

__ `Setups and teardowns`_

All top-level keywords are executed when tests have templates
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

When using `test templates`_, all the data rows are always executed to
make it sure that all the different combinations are tested. In this
usage continuing is limited to the top-level keywords, and inside them
the execution ends normally if there are non-continuable failures.

Stopping test execution gracefully
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes there is a need to stop the test execution before all the tests
have finished, but so that logs and reports are created. Different ways how
to accomplish this are explained below. In all these cases the remaining
test cases are marked failed. 

.. Note:: Most of these features are new in Robot Framework 2.5. Only
          the `ExitOnFailure mode`_ is supported in earlier versions.

Pressing :code:`Ctrl-C`
'''''''''''''''''''''''

The execution is stopped when :code:`Ctrl-C` is pressed in the console
where the tests are running. When running the tests on Python, the
execution is stopped immediately, but with Jython it ends only after
the currently executing keyword ends.

If :code:`Ctrl-C` is pressed again, the execution ends immediately and
reports and logs are not created.

Using signals
'''''''''''''

On Unix-like machines it is possible to terminate test execution
using signals :code:`INT` and :code:`TERM`. These signals can be sent
from the command line using :prog:`kill` command, and sending signals can
also be easily automated.

Signals have the same limitation on Jython as pressing :code:`Ctrl-C`.
Similarly also the second signal stops the execution forcefully.

Using keywords
''''''''''''''

The execution can be stopped also by the executed keywords. There is a
separate :name:`Fatal Error` `BuiltIn keyword`_ for this purpose, and
custom keywords can use `fatal exceptions`__ when they fail.

__ `Stopping test execution`_

:opt:`ExitOnFailure` mode
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

If option :opt:`--runmode` is used with value :opt:`ExitOnFailure`
(case-insensitive), the execution of tests stops immediately if 
a `critical test`_ fails and the remaining tests are marked as failed.

Handling teardowns
''''''''''''''''''

By default teardowns for tests and suites that have been started are executed
even if test execution is stopped using one of the methods above. This allows
clean-up activities to be run regardless how execution ends.

Starting from Robot Framework 2.5.2, teardowns are skipped when the execution is
stopped if the :opt:`--runmode SkipTeardownOnExit` command line option is used.
This can be useful if clean-up takes a lot of time.
