Rebot command line options
--------------------------

Options:

  -N, --name <name>       Set the name of the top level test suite. Name is
                          automatically capitalized and underscores converted
                          to spaces.
  -D, --doc <document>    Set the document of the top level test suite.
                          Underscores in the document are turned into spaces
                          and it may also contain simple HTML formatting (e.g.
                          \*bold\*, _italic_ and http://url/).
  -M, --metadata <name:value>  Set metadata of the top level test suite. Name is
                          automatically capitalized and underscores converted
                          to spaces. Value can contain same HTML formatting as
                          --doc. 
  -G, --settag <tag>      Sets given tag(s) to all executed test cases. 
  -t, --test <name>       Select test cases by name. Name is case and space
                          insensitive and it can also be a simple pattern where
                          '\*' matches anything and '?' matches any character.
  -s, --suite <name>        Select test suites by name. When this option is used
                          with --test, --include or --exclude, only test cases
                          in matching suites and also matching other filtering
                          criteria are selected. 
  -i, --include <tag>     Select test cases by tag. Similarly as name in --test
                          tag is case and space insensitive and it can also be
                          a simple pattern. To include only tests which have 
                          more than one tag use '&' or 'AND' between tag names.
  -e, --exclude <tag>     Unselect test cases by tag. These tests are not
                          selected even if they are included with --include.
                          Tag names are handled similarly as in --include and
                          excluding only tests containing multiple tags works
                          works the same way using '&' or 'AND'.
  -c, --critical <tag>    Tests having given tag are considered critical. If no
                          critical tags are set, all tags are critical. Tags
                          can be given as a pattern like e.g. with --test.
                          Resets possible critical tags set earlier.
  -n, --noncritical <tag>  Tests with given tag are not critical even if they
                          have a tag set with --critical. Tag can be a pattern.
                          Resets possible non critical tags set earlier.
  -d, --outputdir <dir>   Where to create output files. The default is the
                          directory where Rebot is run from and the given path
                          is considered relative to that unless it is absolute.
  -o, --output <file>     XML output file. Not created unless this option is
                          specified. Given path, similarly as paths given to
                          --log, --report and --summary, is relative to
                          --outputdir unless given as an absolute path.
                          Default is 'output.xml'. 
  -l, --log <file>        HTML log file. Can be disabled by giving a special
                          name 'NONE'. 
  -r, --report <file>     HTML report file. Can be disabled with 'NONE'
                          similarly as --log. Default is 'report.html'.
  -S, --summary <file>    HTML summary report. Not created unless this option
                          is specified. 
  -T, --timestampoutputs  When this option is used, timestamp in a format
                          'YYYYMMDD-hhmmss' is added to all generated output 
                          files between their basename and extension.
  --splitoutputs <level>  Split output and log files from specified suite 
                          level to make them smaller in size. Top level files
                          have links to lower level files for easy navigation.
  --logtitle <title>    Title for the generated test log. The default title
                          is '<Name Of The Suite> Test Log'. Underscores in
                          the title are converted into spaces in all titles.
  --reporttitle <title>  Title for the generated test report. The default
                          title is '<Name Of The Suite> Test Report'.
  --summarytitle <title>  Title for the generated summary report. The default
                          title is '<Name Of The Suite> Summary Report'.
  --suitestatlevel <level>  How many levels to show in 'Statistics by Suite'
                          table in outputs. By default all suite levels are
                          shown. If zero (0) is given the whole table is 
                          removed. Example: '--suitestatlevel 3'
  --tagstatinclude <tag>  Include only these tags in 'Statistics by Tag' and
                          and 'Test Details by Tag' tables in outputs. By
                          default all tags set in test cases are shown. Given
                          'tag' can also be a simple pattern (see e.g. --test).
  --tagstatexclude <tag>  Exclude these tags from 'Statistics by Tag' and
                          'Test Details by Tag' tables in outputs. This option
                          can be used with --tagstatinclude similarly as
                          --exclude is used with --include.
  --tagstatcombine <tags>  Create combined statistics based on tags. These
                          statistics are added into 'Statistics by Tag' table 
                          and matching tests into 'Test Details by Tag' table.
                          There are three ways to give these tags.
                          1) One tag as a simple pattern. Tests having a tag
                          matching the pattern are included. Example: 'it-\*'
                          2) Two or more tags (or patterns) separated by '&' or
                          'AND'. Only tests having all these tags are included.
                          3) Two or more tags (or patterns) separated by 'NOT'.
                          Tests having the first tag but not any of the latter
                          ones are included. Example: 'it-10NOTsmoke'
  --tagdoc <pattern:doc>  Add documentation to tags matching given pattern. 
                          Documentation is shown in 'Test Details by Tag' 
                          table and also as a tooltip in 'Statistics by Tag' 
                          table. Pattern can contain characters '\*' (matches 
                          anything) and '?' (matches any char). In case of 
                          multiple matches, documentations are catenated with
                          spaces. Documentation can contain formatting as with
                          --doc option.
  --tagstatlink <pattern:link:title>  Adds links into 'Statistics by Tag' 
                          table in outputs. Pattern can contain characters '\*' 
                          (matches anything) and '?' (matches any character).
                          Character(s) matching to wildcard expression(s) can 
                          be used in the resulting link with syntax %N, where N
                          is the index of the match (starting from 1). In title
                          underscores are automatically converted to spaces.
  --removekeywords <all|passed>  Remove keyword data from generated outputs. 
                          Keyword data is not needed when creating reports and
                          removing it can make the size of an output file
                          considerably smaller.
                          'all'    - remove data from all keywords
                          'passed' - remove data only from keywords in passed
                          test cases and suites
  --starttime <timestamp>  Set starting time of test execution when creating
                          combined reports. Timestamp must be given in format
                          '2007-10-01 15:12:42.268' where all separators are
                          optional (e.g. '20071001151242268' is ok too) and
                          parts from milliseconds to hours can be omitted if
                          they are zero (e.g. '2007-10-01'). If this option is
                          not used, starttime of combined reports is 'N/A'.
  --endtime <timestamp>   Same as --starttime but for ending time. If both 
                          options are used, elapsed time is calculated based on
                          them. Otherwise it is calculated by adding elapsed 
                          times of sub tests suites together.
  -E, --escape <what:with>  Escape characters which are problematic in console.
                          'what' is the name of the character to escape and
                          'with' is the string to escape it with. Note that
                          all given arguments, incl. data sources, are escaped
                          so escape characters ought to be selected carefully.
                          Available escapes: amp (&), apos ('), at (@), bslash
                          (\), colon (:), comma (,), curly1 ({), curly2 (}),
                          dollar ($), exclam (!), gt (>), hash (#), lt (<),
                          paren1 ((), paren2 ()), percent (%), pipe (|), quest
                          (?), quot ("), semic (;), slash (/), space ( ),
                          square1 ([), square2 (]), star (\*)
  -A, --argumentfile <path>   Text file to read more arguments from. File can have
                          both options and data sources one per line. Contents
                          don't need to be escaped but spaces in the beginning
                          and end of lines are removed. Empty lines and lines
                          starting with a hash character (#) are ignored.
  -h, --help              Print usage instructions.
  --version               Print version information.


Environment Variables:

ROBOT_SYSLOG_FILE         Path to the syslog file. If not specified, or set to
                          special value 'NONE', writing to syslog file is 
                          disabled. Path must be absolute. 
ROBOT_SYSLOG_LEVEL        Log level to use when writing to the syslog file.
                          Available levels are the same as for --loglevel 
                          option to Robot and the default is INFO.
