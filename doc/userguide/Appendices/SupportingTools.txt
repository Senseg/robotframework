In this appendix, the available supporting tools for Robot Framework
are described. Unless otherwise stated later in this chapter, the
tools can be downloaded from the `Robot Framework supporting tools page`_.

Test data editing tool (Robot IDE)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot IDE is a standalone tool for editing test data. It helps in
creating, editing and maintaining of Robot Framework test
data.

Javalibcore
~~~~~~~~~~~

Javalibcore is a common core for all Java libraries of Robot Framework. 

The main advantages of this core are: 

    - It is easily extensible and dynamic; you can add keywords to the class path. 
    - There is no need for a library; you can just implement keywords. 
    - There is common functionality readily available (for example, argument count checking for keywords) 

Robot Framework supports two kinds of Java libraries. The simpler way
is to have a single library class, which has keywords as methods. This
is a very easy way to get started, but as the number of keywords grows,
this approach soon leads to bad design and hard-to-maintain code, even if you
split the keywords into several classes.

The other, better way of doing this is to have a library that
implements the methods :code:`String[] getKeywordNames()` and
:code:`Object runKeyword(String keywordName, Object[]
arguments)`. This enables you to decide how you want to run and
implement your keywords.

Javalibcore provides an implementation of the latter library
model. You can add keywords either by simply implementing a Keyword
interface and having your classes in the classpath when running Robot Framework,
or by using Spring configuration files to wire them.


Provided libraries
'''''''''''''''''' 

These libraries do not provide any keywords. They are mere common
implementations of libraries so you do not need to create your own, but you only
need to write keyword implementations. The principle of how the libraries find the
keywords is explained below.

ClassPathLibrary
```````````````` 

ClassPathLibrary searches for keywords in the class path. The class
name is mapped to a keyword name. To create a keyword with the name
:kw:`Do My Specific Task`, you simply implement a keyword class called
DoMySpecificTask and add it to the class path.

A keyword implementation has to meet the following requirements: 

  - It is a class that implements the com.nokia.robot.javalib.core.keyword.Keyword interface. 
  - The name matches the pattern com/nokia/\**/keyword/\**/\**.class. 
  - The class has a default constructor. 
  - The class is public and non-abstract. 

See the Examples part in the Downloads section of `Javalib-core Wiki pages`__ to get started.

SpringLibrary
````````````` 

ClassPathLibrary maps one keyword to one class. It also limits the
implementation, because it requires a default constructor. If this is
a problem, you can use Spring configuration files to wire keywords any
way you want. Here is an example of a Spring configuration file:

::

 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN"
	 "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd">

 <beans>
   <bean id="componentShouldBeVisible" class="com.nokia.oss.mycomponent.keyword.ComponentVisibility">
     <constructor-arg type="boolean" value="true">
   </bean>

   <bean id="componentShouldNotBeVisible" class="com.nokia.oss.mycomponent.keyword.ComponentVisibility">
     <constructor-arg type="boolean" value="false">
   </bean>
 </beans>

The pattern used to find configuration files is
com/nokia/\**/keywords.xml. Only beans of type
com.nokia.robot.javalib.core.keyword.Keyword are interpreted to be
keyword implementations.

For more information about Spring Framework, see http://www.springframework.org/. 


CompositeLibrary
````````````````
 
CompositeLibrary simply combines SpringLibrary and ClassPathLibrary. With CompositeLibrary, you can use either way to add new keywords. 


Common functionality 
''''''''''''''''''''
.. TODO: Add some short introductory text here.

ArgumentCheckingKeyword
```````````````````````
 
With a lot of keywords you want to check that you get the correct
number of arguments from the user. In Javalib-core, there is an abstract class
that you can extend to achieve this behavior. Please see the source
code for com.nokia.robot.javalib.core.keyword.ArgumentCheckingKeyword.


PreparableKeyword
````````````````` 

If your keyword needs to be prepared in some way for it to work, you
can use com.nokia.robot.core.keyword.PreparableKeyword. For example,
in the Prepare method you can check that the current context that you
are working in is correct for the keyword.
