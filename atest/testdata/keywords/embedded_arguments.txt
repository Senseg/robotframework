Complex Embedded Arguments
    Given this "feature" works
    When this "test case" is *executed*
    Then this "issue" is about to be done!

Embedded Arguments as Variables
    ${name}  ${item} =  User ${42} Selects ${EMPTY} From Webshop
    Should Be Equal  ${name}-${item}  42-
    ${name}  ${item} =  User ${name} Selects ${SPACE * 10} From Webshop
    Should Be Equal  ${name}-${item}  42-${SPACE*10}
    ${name}  ${item} =  User ${name} Selects ${TEST TAGS} From Webshop
    Should Be Equal  ${name}  ${42}
    Should Be True  ${item} == []

Non-Existing Variable in Embedded Arguments
    [Documentation]  FAIL Non-existing variable '${non existing}'.
    User ${non existing} Selects ${variables} From Webshop

Escaping Values Given As Embedded Arguments
    ${name}  ${item} =  User \${nonex} Selects \\ From Webshop
    Should Be Equal  ${name}-${item}  \${nonex}-\\
    ${name}  ${item} =  User \ Selects \ \ From Webshop
