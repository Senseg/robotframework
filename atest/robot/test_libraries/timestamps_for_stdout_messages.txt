*** Test Cases ***

Library adds timestamp as integer
    ${tc} =  Check Test Case  ${TESTNAME}
    Known timestamp should be correct  ${tc.kws[0].msgs[0]}
    Current timestamp should be smaller than kw end time  ${tc.kws[0]}

Library adds timestamp as float
    ${tc} =  Check Test Case  ${TESTNAME}
    Known timestamp should be correct  ${tc.kws[0].msgs[0]}
    Current timestamp should be smaller than kw end time  ${tc.kws[0]}
