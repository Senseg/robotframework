This simple example how to use C libraries with Robot Framework (RF) in linux
environment. The application is validating user name and 
password and prints out is the login successful or not. There are two 
valid username password combinations demo mode and john long.

The example consists of four files:
login.c         : Application that will be tested using RF
LoginLibrary.py	: Python interface to C library
LoginTests.tsv  : Tests that run against C library
Makefile        : Used to compile the C file

To use this example run make in the directory where you unzipped the 
RF-C-Sample package. This will create library liblogin.so that is 
shared library that is needed to use ctypes python module. Run test by typing 
> pybot LoginTests.tsv.

You can run the application as standalone using e.g. command 
> python LoginLibrary.py demo mode
