Introduction
------------

There are two ways to install Robot Framework, depending on how you got it.

`Installing from source`_
    You can get the source code either as a source distribution package
    or directly from our version control. In the former case, you need to
    first extract the package somewhere, and as a result, you got a
    directory named ``robotframework-<version>``. Detailed instructions
    follow, but in short, what you need to do is to go to the created
    directory and run the ``python setup.py install`` command.

`Installing using binary installer`_
    Binary installers are platform-specific and using them should be
    familiar to anyone who has ever installed anything on that
    particular platform. We currently have graphical installers for
    Windows and an RPM package for several Linux flavours.

Installation packages are available from:  

**TODO**: add correct URL

For more details about different installation packages and possible
future formats, see the PACKAGING.txt file.


Installation
------------

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robot Framework runs both on Python_ and Jython_ and you need to have
at least one of them to be able to use it. Installing Robot Framework
automatically is only possible with Python and installing it is
recommended.


Python Installation
'''''''''''''''''''

Python 2.5 is recommended, although Python 2.4 and 2.3 are also
supported. On most unixy systems, you have Python installed by
default. If you are on Windows or otherwise need to install Python
yourself, your best place to start is probably `Python
homepage`_. There you can download a suitable installer and get more
information about installation and Python in general.

.. Note:: Python installation framework coming with Python 2.3 does not
          have functionality for copying other than Python
          files. Robot Framework itself can be installed with it
          without problems, but installing e.g. certain libraries may
          require copying those non-Python files manually.


Jython Installation
'''''''''''''''''''

Using test libraries implemented with Java or directly using Java
tools requires running Robot Framework on Jython_. A precondition for
Jython is having Java 1.4 or newer installed. Both Sun and IBM Java
versions are supported and you only need Java Runtime Environment
(JRE). Newer Java versions are recommended, as they tend to be faster 
with dynamic languages like Jython.

Jython version to use with Robot Framework is 2.2. At least Jython
2.2.1 has problems with Unicode in certain cases (see
http://jython.org/bugs/1802339 for more details), but they are hopefully
fixed in later 2.2.x versions.

Some unixy systems have Jython automatically available, but they still
seem to have 2.1 version which is *not* compatible with Robot
Framework. Installing Jython is, luckily, a pretty easy procedure. You
need to first get an installer from `Jython homepage`_ and then
run it. Note that the installer is an executable JAR package, which you
need to run like ``java -jar jython_installer-2.2.jar``. Depending on
your system, the installer will either run in the graphical or textual mode,
but in both cases, the actual installation procedure is really easy.

Robot Framework installer tries to find the Jython executable on the
system, in order to create the jybot start-up script correctly. Jython
will be found if:

1. The Jython executable is in the PATH environment variable.

2. An environment variable JYTHON_HOME is set and it points to
   a directory containing the Jython executable.

3. Jython installation dir is found. On Windows machines, it is
   searched from 'C:\\' and 'D:\\' drives, and on other systems from
   '/usr/local' and '/opt' directories. The directory will be found if
   it is under the search directories mentioned above, or one level
   deeper.  For example, following Jython installation directories
   would be found by the installer::

     C:\APPS\Jython2.2
     D:\Jython22RC2
     /usr/local/jython2.2.1
     /opt/more/jython2.2

If you plan to use Robot Framework only with Jython, you do not
necessarily need Python at all. In that case you need to do a `manual
installation`_ or have some custom installer.


Installing From Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As already mentioned, you can get Robot Framework source either as a
source distribution package (which you need to extract somewhere) or
directly from version control. In both cases, you should have a
directory containing source code, documentation, tools, templates,
etc. The first installation step is going to the created directory
from command line, and after that you can install Robot Framework by
running the following command::

  python setup.py install

You get a quite long output and something like the following text should
appear at the end::

  Creating Robot start-up scripts...

  Installation directory: /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/robot
  Python executable: /usr/bin/python
  Jython executable: /cygdrive/c/jython2.2b2/jython.bat (found from system)
  Pybot script: /usr/bin/pybot
  Jybot script: /usr/bin/jybot
  Rebot script: /usr/bin/rebot


Installing Using Binary Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the platform-specific way of installation.  For example, on
Windows, double click the provided installation executable, and follow
the instructions of the graphical installer.


Manual Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not want to install Python or for some other reason do not
want to use any automatic way for installing Robot Framework, you can
always do it manually following these steps.

1. Get the source code. All the code is in a directory (a module in
   Python) called ``robot``. If you have a source distribution or a version
   control checkout, you can find it from the ``src`` directory, but you can
   also get it from an earlier installation.

2. Copy the source code where you want.

3. Create the needed start-up scripts. If you have a source package or a
   checkout, you can get templates from ``src/bin``.


Where Files Are Installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an automatic installer is used, Robot Framework code is copied
into a directory containing external Python modules. The actual location is
platform-specific, but on unixy machines, it is normally something like
'/usr/lib/[PythonVer]/site-packages' and on Windows it is
'[PythonInstallationDir]\\Lib\\site-packages'. The code is in the directory 
named as robot in the site-packages directory.

Robot Framework start-up scripts (pybot, jybot and rebot) will be 
created and copied into another platform-specific location. On unixy 
machines, they normally go to '/usr/bin' and are thus immediately 
available from command line. On Windows, there is not a similar natural 
place, and scripts go '[PythonInstallationDir]\\Scripts'. 


Setting Up The Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start-Up Scripts
''''''''''''''''

The Robot Framework installer creates start-up scripts and copies them
to platform-dependent locations as explained above. On unixy machines,
they should be automatically available from command line, but on
Windows they are not. On Windows, and possible other environments where
startup scripts are not available, the directory containing them must
be set to the PATH environment variable.

.. TIP:: Setting PATH in Windows

   Open ``Start > Settings > Control Panel > System > Advanced >
   Environment Variables``.  There are User variables and System
   variables, the difference between them is that User Variables affect
   only the current users, System Variables affect all users.  If the
   PATH environment variable does not exist, you can create it by
   choosing 'New'. An existing variable may be edited by choosing
   'Edit'. You should insert ';C:\\[PythonDir]\\Scripts\\' into the
   'Variable Value' field in the edit dialog, where [PythonDir] is
   your Python installation directory.

   A new command prompt needs to be started for the changes to take effect.

Python And Jython
'''''''''''''''''

If you followed `Jython installation`_ guidelines above, or do not need
Jython at all, you should not need to do any more configuring. You may
want to make sure Python and Jython are available from command line
and if not, add their installation directories into PATH.

If you installed Jython into a location where Robot Framawork
installer could not find it, you need to either update the ``jybot`` script
manually or set the Jython installation directory to PATH.


Verifying Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can verify the success of the installation and environment setup by typing::

  pybot --version 

Something similar to::

  Robot 2.0 (Python 2.5.1 on cygwin)

should appear on the output.

To verify that Robot Framework works also with Jython, type::

  jybot --version

The expected output in this case is similar to::

  Robot 2.0 (Jython 2.2 on java1.6.0_02)


Upgrading
---------

If you are upgrading from one minor Robot Framework version to another
(for example, from 2.0 to 2.0.1), it should be safe to install the new
version over the old one.

If you are upgrading from one major Robot version to another (for
example, from 2.0 to 2.1), then it is highly recommended to uninstall
the old version before the new installation.

If you are downgrading, the rules are same as for upgrading.


Uninstallation
--------------

If Robot Framework is installed from a binary distribution, it can be
uninstalled via the mechanism offered by the operating system. For
example in Windows you simply go to ``Control Panel >
Add/Remove Programs``. Note that Robot Framework is listed under
Python.

If installed from source, or if the removal of binary installation is
unsuccesful, Robot Framework may be uninstalled by removing the
framework code and start-up scripts manually. See the `Where Files Are
Installed`_ section above for more information where to find them.
