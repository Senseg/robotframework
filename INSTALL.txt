Installation and uninstallation
===============================


Introduction
------------

There are three ways to install Robot Framework, depending on how you got it.

Installing from source

    You can get the source code either as a source distribution package or
    directly from our version control. Since you are reading this file, you
    must have been able to get that far.

Installing using binary installer

    Binary installers are platform-specific and using them should be familiar 
    to anyone who has ever installed anything on that particular platform.
    
Installing using `easy_install`

    If Python package managing tool `easy_install` is available, installation 
    is as easy as running command `easy_install robotframework`. For more 
    information about `easy_install`, go to 
    http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall.


This file contains brief instructions for installation and
uninstallation from source. More detailed instructions can be found
from Robot Framework User Guide, which can be found from doc/userguide
directory and from http://robotframework.org.

Robot Framework runs both on Python and Jython, but the normal
installation procedure explained here works only with Python. See
the user guide for more information about Python and Jython
installation, recommended versions, installation without Python, and
so on.


Installation
------------

Robot Framework can be installed using either `setup.py` or
`install.py` script. The former is a standard Python installer script,
and it has capabilities like installing into a non-default
location. The latter is a custom installation and uninstallation
script for Robot Framework, and it uses `setup.py` internally for
installation. Following installation commands are thus equivalent::

    python setup.py install
    python install.py install

With both of these commands you get a quite long output and something
like the following text should appear at the end::

    Creating Robot start-up scripts...

    Installation directory: /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/robot
    Python executable: /usr/bin/python
    Jython executable: /cygdrive/c/jython2.2b2/jython.bat (found from system)
    Pybot script: /usr/bin/pybot
    Jybot script: /usr/bin/jybot
    Rebot script: /usr/bin/rebot


Robot Framework runner scripts (`pybot`, `jybot`, `rebot`) are
installed to platform-dependent locations. On Windows, and possible
other environments where runner scripts are not available on the
command line automatically, the directory containing them must be set
to the PATH environment variable. How to do that is explained in the
user guide.

To verify that the installation and environment setup were successful,
type::

  $ pybot --version 
  Robot 2.0 (Python 2.5.1 on cygwin)

To verify that Robot Framework works also with Jython, type::

  $ jybot --version
  Robot 2.2 (Jython 2.2 on java1.6.0_03)

In both cases, the exact version and platform information can, of course,
differ from these. On Jython, you may also get some notifications from
Jython's package manager upon the first execution.


Uninstallation and reinstallation
---------------------------------

`install.py` can be used both for uninstallation and reinstallation
with commands::

    python install.py uninstall
    python install.py reinstall
