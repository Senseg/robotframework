Synopsis
--------

::

    libdoc.py [options] library_or_resource_file


Options
-------
    
  -a, --argument <value>   Possible arguments that a library needs. Available
                           only in versions distributed with Robot Framework 
                           2.0.4 and newer.
  -f, --format <HTML|XML>  Specifies whether to generate HTML or XML output. 
                           The default value is HTML.
  -o, --output <path>      Specifies where to write the generated documentation. 
                           If the given path is a directory, the documentation
                           is written there using a file name like 
                           '<name>.<format>'. If a file with that name already
                           exists, an index is added after the '<name>' part.
                           If the given path is not a directory, it is used 
                           directly and possible existing files are overwritten. 
                           The default value for the path is the directory
                           where the script is executed from.
  -N, --name <newname>     Sets the name of the documented library or resource.
                           Available only in 2.0.4 and newer.
  -T, --title <title>      Sets the title of the generated HTML documentation.
                           Underscores in the given title are automatically
                           converted to spaces. Available only in 2.0.4 and 
                           newer.
  -P, --pythonpath <path>  Additional path(s) to insert into PYTHONPATH.
  -E, --escape <what:with>  Escapes characters which are problematic in console.
                           :opt:`what` is the name of the character to escape 
                           and :opt:`with` is the string to escape it with.
                           Available escapes are listed in the :opt:`--help`
                           output. Available only in 2.0.4 and newer.
  -h, --help               Prints this help.


Description
-----------

:prog:`libdoc.py` generate keyword documentation from test libraries
and resource files either in the HTML or XML format. The former is for
humans and the latter mainly for Robot Framework IDE or other tools.

Documentation can be created for:

- Test libraries implemented with Python__ or Java__ using the normal library API.
- Test libraries using the `dynamic API`__.
- `Resource files`_.

__ `Python libraries`_
__ `Java libraries`_
__ `Dynamic libraries`_

It is possible to specify a Python test library by giving either the
path to the source or only the library name. If the library name is
used, it must be in the same format as in the Robot Framework test
data when importing libraries. In this case, the library is searched
from PYTHONPATH (and from CLASSPATH, if on Jython).

A Java test library implemented with a normal library API can be
specified by giving the path to the source code file containing the
library implementation. Additionally, :path:`tools.jar`, which is part
of the Sun JDK distribution, must be found from CLASSPATH when
:prog:`libdoc.py` is executed. When generating documentation for Java 
libraries, :prog:`libdoc.py` must be executed using Jython.

Libraries using the dynamic library API are handled in the same way as Python 
libraries.

Possible arguments to libraries can be given using :opt:`--argument`
option, which can be used multiple times to specify multiple
arguments. Libraries always get these arguments as strings. If
arguments change what keywords the library provides or otherwise
change its behaviour, it might be a good idea to use :opt:`--name`
option to also change the library name accordingly. Note that these
options only work with :prog:`libdoc.py` distributed with Robot
Framework 2.0.4 and newer.

Resource files must always be specified using a path. If the path does not 
exist, resource files are also searched from all directories in PYTHONPATH.

Examples::

   $ python libdoc.py OperatingSystem
   $ python libdoc.py --output doc/MyLib.html src/MyLib.py
   $ python libdoc.py --argument arg1 --argument arg2 LibraryWithArgs.py
   $ python libdoc.py --name MyLibrary --argument 10.0.0.42:8270 Remote.py
   $ python libdoc.py test/resource.html
   $ python libdoc.py --format xml OperatingSystem
   $ python libdoc.py --format xml --output doc test/resource.html
   $ jython libdoc.py --format xml MyJavaLibrary.java


Writing documentation
---------------------

For more information about how to actually create test libraries and resource
files see `Robot Framework User Guide`__.

__ `user guide`_

  
Python libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation for Python libraries is written simply as doc
strings for the library class and for methods implementing
keywords. The first line of the method documentation is considered as
a short documentation for the keywords (used for example as a tool tip in
links in the generated HTML documentation), and it should thus be as
describing as possible, but not too long.

The simple example below illustrates how to write the documentation,
and for example `standard libraries`_ give more
realistic examples. For more information on Python documentation
strings, see `PEP-257`__.

__ http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/


.. sourcecode:: python

    class ExampleLib:

        """Library for demo purposes.

        This library is only used in an example and it does't do anything useful.
        """

        def my_keyword(self):
            """Does nothing."""
            pass

        def your_keyword(self, arg):
            """Takes one argument and *does nothing* with it.

            Example:
            | Your Keyword | xxx |
            | Your Keyword | yyy |
            """
            pass


Java libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When writing documentation for a normal Java library, conventions for
writing Javadoc should be used. The documentation is generated based
on the Javadocs in the source files. For example following simple
example has exactly same documentation (and functionality) than the
earlier Python example.

.. sourcecode:: java

    /** 
     * Library for demo purposes.
     *
     * This library is only used in an example and it does't do anything useful.
     */
    public class ExampleLib {

        /** 
         * Does nothing 
         */
        public void myKeyword() {
        }

        /** 
         * Takes one argument and *does nothing* with it.
         *
         * Example:
         * | Your Keyword | xxx |
         * | Your Keyword | yyy |
         */
        public void yourKeyword(String arg) {
        }
    }


Dynamic libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be able to generate meaningful documentation for dynamic libraries,
they must return keyword argument names and documentation using
:code:`get_keyword_arguments` and :code:`get_keyword_documentation`
methods (or using their camelCase variants :code:`getKeywordArguments`
and :code:`getKeywordDocumentation`). See the `user guide`_ for more
information about how to create these methods and the dynamic library
API in general.


Importing section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A separate section about how the library is imported is created based on its
initialization methods. For a Python library, if it has an  :code:`__init__` method
that takes arguments in addition to :code:`self`, the documentation of that
method is shown. For a Java library, if it has a constructor that accepts
arguments, all its constructors and their javadocs are shown.

.. sourcecode:: python

   class TestLibrary:

       def __init__(self, mode='default')
           """Creates new TestLibrary. `mode` argument is used to determine mode."""
           self.mode = mode

       def some_keyword(self, arg):
           if self.mode == 'secret':
                # ...


Resource files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Keywords in resource files can have documentation using
:opt:`[Documentation]` setting, and this documentation is also used by
:prog:`libdoc.py`. First line of the documentation (until the first
:code:`\\n`) is considered to be the short documentation similarly as
with test libraries.

Possible variables in resource files are not documented.


Documentation formatting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `user guide`_ has an appendix explaining different documentation
formatting possibilities. Most important fearues are formatting using
:code:`*bold*` and :code:`_italic_`, automatic conversion of URLs to
clickable links, and the possibility to create tables (useful for
examples) simply with pipe character::

   | Some Keyword    | arg |
   | Another Keyword |     |

In addition to the formatting explained in the user guide,
:prog:`libdoc.py` supports also special formatting of keyword names
and arguments with backtick character :code:`\``. Even more
importantly, this syntax also automatically creates internal links to
other keywords in the library. For example documentation of the
following simple Python library would have link from :name:`Log
Messages` to :name:`Log Message`, and :code:`\`message\`` and
:code:`\`level\`` would be formatted specially.

.. sourcecode:: python

   def log_message(message, level="INFO"):
       """Writes given message to log using specified log level.

       `message` can be any object. Valid values for `level` are "INFO" (default),
       "DEBUG" and "TRACE".
       """
       print "*%s* %s" % (level, message)

   def log_messages(message1, message2, level="INFO"):
       """Writes given messages to log using specified log level.

       See `Log Message` keyword for more information about valid values 
       for `level`.
       """
       log_message(message1, level)
       log_message(message2, level)


Additionally, using :code:`\`introduction\`` or :code:`\`library introduction\``
(case insensitive) generates a link to the library introduction in the beginneing
of the generated documentation. Similarly :code:`\`importing\``
or :code:`\`library importing\`` generates a link to the `importing section`_.

Internal linking between keywords is used by all `standard
libraries`_, so their documentation (and source) acts as a more
realistic example.


Keyword arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:prog:`libdoc.py` handles keyword arguments automatically so that
arguments specified for methods in libraries or user keywords in
resource files are listed in a separate column. Possible trailing
spaces in argument names are stripped to make it possible to use
arguments like :code:`list_` in the code and still have :code:`list`
in documentation. Additionally, user keyword arguments are shown
without :var:`${}` or :var:`@{}` to make arguments look the same
regardless where keywords originated from.
