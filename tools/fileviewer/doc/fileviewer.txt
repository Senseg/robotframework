File viewer is a tool designed to be used together with the Robot
Framework command line option :cli:`--debugfile`. The debug file can be
opened with File viewer, and the viewer will automatically update the
display as the debug file gets written, so that it is possible to
scroll the file when it is being written to.

The tool can be downloaded from here:
https://cwiki.nokia.com/twiki/pub/RobotFramework/FileViewerTool/fileviewer.py.txt

.. Note:: Because of TWiki security restrictions, the filename has a
   	  :path:`.txt` extension. That must be removed, so the file must be saved
 	  as :path:`fileviewer.py`.

To use the tool, you can either double-click the icon and click the
``Open`` button in the GUI to open the desired file, or you can start
the tool from the command line and give the path to the debug file as
an argument, for example::

   python fileviewer.py mydebugfile.txt
