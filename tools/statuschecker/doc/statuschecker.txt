A tool for further processing of Robot Framework output files.

Synopsis
--------

::

    statuschecker.py infile [outfile]


Description
-----------

This tool processes Robot Framework output XML files and checks that test case
statuses and messages are as expected. Main use case is post-processing output
files got when testing Robot Framework test libraries using Robot Framework
itself. 

If output file is not given, the input file is considered to be also output 
file and it is edited in place.


Defining expected test status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default all test cases are expected to 'PASS' and have no message. Changing
the expected status to 'FAIL' is done by having word 'FAIL' (in uppercase)
somewhere in the test case documentation. Expected error message must then be
given after 'FAIL'. Error message can also be specified as a regular expression
by prefixing it with 'REGEXP:'. Having spaces between the status, the message
or the possible regexp prefix is optional. 

Defining expected keyword log messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Expected keyword log messages can also be defined in the test case documentation
using syntax like::
    
     LOG x.y:z message


For example, following documentation expects that the test case fails with 
message 'Expected message', and in addition, the second log message of first keyword
is 'Log message'::

    FAIL: Expected failure LOG 1:2 Log message

The message index (number after ':') is by default 1, so if you check the first
log message of given keyword, it may be omitted.
