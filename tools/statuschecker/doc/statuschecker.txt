===================================
Robot Framework Test Status Checker
===================================


Usage:  statuschecker.py infile [outfile]

This tool processes Robot Framework output XML files and checks that test case
statuses and messages are as expected. Main use case is post-processing output
files got when testing Robot Framework test libraries using Robot Framework
itself. 

If output file is not given, the input file is considered to be also output 
file and it is edited in place.

By default all test cases are expected to 'PASS' and have no message. Changing
the expected status to 'FAIL' is done by having word 'FAIL' (in uppercase)
somewhere in the test case documentation. Expected error message must then be
given after 'FAIL'. Error message can also be specified as a regular expression
by prefixing it with 'REGEXP:'. Having spaces between the status, the message
or the possible regexp prefix is optional. Everything before 'FAIL' is ignored.
