Synopsis

::

    robotdiff.py [options] input files


Options
-------

  -r, --report <file>       HTML report file (created from the input files).
                            Default is 'robotdiff.html'.
  -n, --name <name>         Name for test run. Different test runs can be named
                            with this option. However, there must be as many 
                            names as there are input files. By default the name
                            of the input files are used as names. Input files 
                            having same file name are distinguished by adding 
                            as many parent directories to the names as is needed.
  -t, --title <title>       Title for the generated diff report. The default
                            title is 'Diff Report'.
  -E, --escape <what:with>  Escape certain characters which are problematic in
                            console. 'what' is the name of the character to 
                            escape and 'with' is the string to escape it with.
                            Available character to escape: %(ESCAPES)s
                            Example: :cli:`-\\-escape space:_ -\\-title My_Diff_Report`
  -h, --help                Print this usage instruction.



Description
-----------

This script compares two or more Robot Framework output files and creates a 
report where possible differences between test case statuses in each file 
are highlighted. Main use case is verifying that results from executing same
test cases in different environments are same. For example, it is possible to
test that new Robot Framework version does not affect test results. Another 
usage is comparing earlier test results with newer ones to find out possible
status changes and added test cases.   

Examples::

    $ robotdiff.py output1.xml output2.xml output3.xml
    $ robotdiff.py --name Env1 --name Env2 smoke1.xml smoke2.xml
