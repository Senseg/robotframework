============

:prog:`robotdiff.py` is a tool for comparing two or more Robot Framework output
files. It is included in source distributions and can also be downloaded from
http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/TestResultDiffingTool.

Synopsis
--------

::

    robotdiff.py [options] input files

Options
-------

  -r, --report <file>       The HTML report file (created from the input files).
                            The default is :path:`robotdiff.html`.
  -n, --name <name>         The name for the test run. Different test runs can
                            be named with this option. There must be as many
                            names as there are input files. By default, the name
                            of the input files are used as names. Input files
                            with the same file name are distinguished by adding
                            as many parent directories to the names as needed.
  -t, --title <title>       The title for the generated diff report. The default
                            title is "Diff Report".
  -E, --escape <what:with>  Escapes certain characters that are problematic in
                            the console. "what" is the name of the character to
                            escape and "with" is the string to escape it with.
                            The available characters to escape are same as for
                            Robot Framework. Example: :cli:`-\\-escape space:_
                            -\\-title My_Diff_Report`
  -h, --help                Prints this usage instruction.

Description
-----------

This script compares two or more Robot Framework output files and
creates a report, where possible differences between test case
statuses in each file are highlighted. The main use case is verifying
that results from executing the same test cases in different
environments are the same. For example, you can test that a new Robot
Framework version does not affect your test results. Another usage is
comparing earlier test results with newer ones to find out possible
status changes and added test cases.

Examples::

    $ robotdiff.py output1.xml output2.xml output3.xml
    $ robotdiff.py --name Env1 --name Env2 smoke1.xml smoke2.xml
