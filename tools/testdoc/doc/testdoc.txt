Description
-----------

This script compares generates a high level documentation of the given Robot
Framework data sources. The generated documentation includes the names of the
suites and tests, as well as the names of the toplevel keywords fir each suite.
Also the total number of tests per suite is available. It is possible to select
suites and tests to be included in the documentation similarly as when choosing
the test cases to be executed with Robot Framework. The test data is parsed 
similarly as when executing the tests, but the variables are not resolved.
 

Examples::

    $ testdoc.py mytestcases.html
    $ testdoc.py --name smoke_test_plan --include smoke my_tests
