One Click Installer installs Robot Framework and its preconditions Python and 
Jython (optional). It also sets Robot Framework start-up scripts (pybot, jybot, 
rebot) as well as Python and Jython executables into %PATH% environment variable 
so that they can be executed from the command line. (Note that you need to restart 
the command prompt for these changes to take effect.) You should use this installer 
ONLY if you don't previously have Python or Jython installed. In that case, and 
also if you want to have a custom installation, you need to install needed 
components separately.

One Click Installer requires that you have all the required component installers 
in the same directory with it and that they have expected names. If Robot Framework 
or Python installer is missing, installation fails. If Jython installer doesn't 
exist, Jython is simply not installed. Note that in order to install Jython, Java 
1.4 or newer must be already installed. Supported versions are Robot Framework 2.x, 
Python 2.5.x and Jython 2.2.x where '.x' means that any minor version (e.g. 2.5 
or 2.5.2) is OK. These installers can be downloaded from respective project websites 
if they are missing. Expected patterns for installer names are 
'robotframework-2.*.exe' , 'python-2.5*.msi' and 'jython_installer-2.2.*.jar'.

The only thing you need to specify is the base directory where to install Python 
and Jython. They are installed into directories 'Python25' and 'Jython22', 
respectively, inside the given base directory. Robot Framework itself is installed 
under Python installation directory and its startup scripts can be found from 
'[PYTHON]\Scripts' and code from '[PYTHON]\Lib\site-packages'.

.. Note::

	The specified base directory MUST exist and Python and Jython directories 
	inside it must not.  It is also not recommended to use a path containing spaces. 
	Good candidates include directories like 'C:\' and 'C:\APPS'.
