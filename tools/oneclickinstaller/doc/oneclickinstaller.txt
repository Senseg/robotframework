An AutoIT__ script for installing Robot Framework and its preconditions
on a Windows machine.

__ http://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/

Description
-----------

One Click Installer installs Robot Framework and its preconditions
Python and Jython (optional). It also sets Robot Framework start-up
scripts (pybot, jybot, rebot), as well as Python and Jython
executables, into the %PATH% environment variable, so that they can be
executed from the command line. (Note that you need to restart the
command prompt for these changes to take effect.) You should use this
installer ONLY if you do not previously have Python or Jython
installed. In that case, and also if you want to have a custom
installation, you need to install the needed components separately.

One Click Installer requires that you have all the required component
installers in the same directory with it and that they have expected
names. If Robot Framework or Python installer is missing, the
installation fails. If Jython installer does not exist, Jython is
simply not installed. Note that in order to install Jython, Java
version 1.4 or newer must be already installed. Supported versions are
Robot Framework version 2.x, Python version 2.5.x and Jython version
2.2.x, where ".x" means that any minor version (e.g. 2.5 or 2.5.2) is
acceptable. If these installers are missing, they can be downloaded
from the respective project web sites. The expected patterns for installer
names are :path:`robotframework-2.*.exe` , :path:`python-2.5*.msi`, and
:path:`jython_installer-2.2.*.jar`.

All you need to specify is the base directory where to install Python and
Jython. They are installed into the directories :path:`Python25` and
:path:`Jython22`, respectively, inside the given base directory. Robot
Framework itself is installed under the Python installation directory. Its
startup scripts can be found from :path:`[PYTHON]\\Scripts` and code from
:path:`[PYTHON]\\Lib\\site-packages`.

.. Note::

	The specified base directory MUST exist, whereas Python and Jython
	directories inside it must not. It is also not recommended to
	use a path containing spaces. Good candidates include
	directories such as :path:`C:\\` and :path:`C:\\APPS`.
