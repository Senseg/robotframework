Options
-------

  -C, --nocritical       Does not plot graphs for critical tests.
  -A, --noall            Does not plot graphs for all tests.
  -T, --nototals         Does not plot total graphs.
  -P, --nopassed         Does not plot passed graphs.
  -F, --nofailed         Does not plot failed graphs.
  -t, --tag <name>       Adds graphs for these tags. The name can contain "\*" and
                         "?" as wildcards. "AND" in the tag name is converted
                         to " & ", to make it easier to plot combined tags.
  -o, --output <path>    The path to the image file to create. If not given, the
                         image is opened into Matplotlib viewer.
  -i, --title <title>    The title of the graph. Underscores in the given title
                         are converted to spaces. By default, there is no
                         title.
  -w, --width <inches>   The width of the image. The default is 800.
  -h, --height <inches>  The height of the image. The default is 400.
  -f, --font <size>      The font size used for legends and labels. The default is 8.
  -m, --marker <size>    The size of the marker used with tag graphs. The default is 5.
  -x, --xticks <num>     The maximum number of ticks on the x-axis. The default is 15.
  -n, --namemeta <name>  The name of the metadata of the top-level test suite
                         where to get the name of the test round. By default, names
                         are got from the paths to input files.
  --argumentfile <path>  Reads arguments from the specified file.
  --verbose              The verbose output.
  --help                 Prints this help.
  --version              Prints the version information.


Additionally, :opt:`---` can be used to group options when creating multiple 
images at once.


Description
-----------

risto.py plots graphs about test execution history, based on statistics read
from Robot output files. By default, it draws total, passed and failed graphs
for critical tests and all tests, but it is possible to omit some of these
graphs and also to add graphs by tags. The actual drawing is handled by the Matplotlib
tool that must be installed separately. More information on Matplotlib, including
the installation instructions, can be found from http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net.

Names of test rounds that are shown on the x-axis are, by default, obtained from the
paths to input files. Alternatively, names can be obtained from the metadata of the
top-level test suite (for more information, see Robot Framework's :opt:`--metadata` option).

Graphs are saved to a file specified with the :opt:`--output` option, and the output
format is determined by the file extension. The supported formats depend on the installed
Matplotlib back-ends, but at least PNG ought to be always available. If the output
file is omitted, the graph is opened into Matplotlib's image viewer (which
requires Matplotlib to be installed with some graphical front end).

It is possible to draw several graphs with different options at once. This is
done by separating different option groups with three or more hyphens (:opt:`---`).
Note that in this case, also paths to input files need to be separated from
the options similarly.

Instead of giving all options from the command line, it is possible to read them
from a file specified with the :opt:`--argument` option. In an argument file, options
and their possible arguments are listed one per line, and option groups are
separated with lines of three or more hyphens. Empty lines and lines starting
with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

Installation
------------

Here you can find the instructions for the installation of risto.py. 

Preconditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
risto.py requires Python. It has been tested both on releases 2.4 and
2.5, and it should work also in 2.3. Also some Robot Framwork modules are
needed, and thus some Robot Framework version 1.8 needs to be
installed.

The Matplotlib tool is used for plotting graphs, and it needs to be
installed separately. Matplotlib has its own preconditions, and at
least NumPy needs to be installed. The default Matplotlib installation
should always support at least PNG, but if more output formats are
needed, some extra back ends may need to be installed. Additionally,
you may need to install graphical front ends to be able to use
Matplotlib's own viewer for opening graphs without saving them to a
file.

risto.py reads statistics from output files using the ElementTree
module. Python 2.5 has this module in its standard library, but for
older versions, it needs to be installed separately.

Screenshots

Here you can find some screenshots of risto.py.

Default settings
````````````````
 
The screenshot below uses some very simple example outputs, thus the lines
are mainly straight. The default settings have been used otherwise,
but the output has been saved into a file with the :opt:`--output
default.png` option.

.. figure:: risto_default.png
   :width: 800
   :height: 400

   Simple example output

Various settings
````````````````
 
The example outputs used in this screenshot are the same as in the previous
one, but now the following options have been specified::

    --nopassed --noall --tag f1 --title Another_Example --width 600 --height 250 --font 6 --marker 3 --output another.png

.. figure:: risto_another.png
   :width: 600
   :height: 250
   
   Another example output

Using Matplotlib's Viewer
`````````````````````````
 
This time there are more input files and the image has been opened
in Matplotlib's viewer (that is, the :opt:`--output` option has not been
used). The options used to create this example are the ones below::

      -CAP -t d1_AND_d2 -t t1 -t sub3 -i Yet_Another_Example -x 20 -w 1000 -n Name

.. figure:: risto_yetanother.png
   :width: 820
   :height: 393
