A tool for creating a CSV file containing suite, test
and keyword execution times (start/end/elapsed time).

Synopsis
--------

::

  times2csv.py input-xml [output-csv]

Description
-----------

This script reads the start, end, and elapsed times from all suites, tests and 
keywords in the given Robot Framework output file and writes them into a file in the
comma-separated-values (CSV) format. If the CSV output file is not given, its 
name is obtained from the input file by replacing the :path:`.xml` extension with 
:path:`.csv`.
