  times2csv.py input-xml [output-csv] [include-items]

Description
-----------

This script reads start, end, and elapsed times from all suites, tests
and/or keywords from the given output file, and writes them into an file
in comma-separated-values (CSV) format. CSV files can then be further
processed with spreadsheet programs. If the CSV output file is not
given, its name is got from the input file by replacing the :path:`.xml`
extension with :path:`.csv`. Include-items can be used for defining which 
items are written. Possible include values are suite, test and keyword and 
those are separated with -. For example when suites' and test cases' 
information is needed include-items needs to be suite-test.

This script reads the start, end, and elapsed times from all suites, tests and/or
keywords in the given Robot Framework output file and writes them into a file in the
comma-separated-values (CSV) format. If the CSV output file is not given, its
name is obtained from the input file by replacing the :path:`.xml` extension with
:path:`.csv`.
