Usage
'''''

::

  times2csv.py input-xml [output-csv]

This script reads start, end, and elapsed times from all suites, tests and 
keywords in the given Robot output file and writes them into a file in the
comma-separated-values (CSV) format. If the CSV output file is not given, its 
name is obtained from the input file by replacing the :path:`.xml` extension with :path:`.csv`.
