This directory contains supporting tools that can be used with Robot

the core framework.  Most tools show a help text describing their
purpose and usage when they are executed from the command line without
arguments or with '--help' option.

    Robot Framework's debug files (see --debugfile option) on Windows and
    systems where `tail` command is not available.
