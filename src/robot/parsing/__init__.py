"""Implements parsing of test data files.

Classes :class:`~.model.TestCaseFile`, :class:`~.model.TestDataDirectory` and
:class:`~.model.ResourceFile` represented parsed test data. These can be
modified and saved back to disk. In addition, a convenience factory function
:func:`~.model.TestData` can be used to parse file or directory to a
corresponding object.

This package is considered stable.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    from robot.parsing import TestCaseFile

    suite = TestCaseFile(source='path/to/tests.html').populate()
    print 'Suite: ', suite.name
    for test in suite.testcase_table:
        print test.name
